	<title>These California Bills Are Still Awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Signature</title>
	<author>Soumya Karlamangla</author>
	<body>Days after a record-breaking heat wave baked California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a sweeping package of climate bills devised to cut emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. These actions from the state, the world’s fifth largest economy, add momentum to worldwide efforts to rein in pollution from the combustion of oil, gas and coal that is overheating the planet.“We could talk about the way the world should be and protest it,” Newsom said at a news conference on Friday. “Or we can actually make demonstrable progress.”Since the California legislative session ended Aug. 31, Newsom signed a bill that made California the first state to require social media sites to install protections for minors, despite opposition from the tech industry. He approved broad-ranging regulations for the fast-food industry. He enacted a law devised to help military service members discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies reestablish their eligibility for Veterans Affairs benefits.But dozens more proposals await Newsom’s vote, five of which I’ll walk you through today. The governor has until Sept. 30 to sign or veto these bills.This bill, known as the California Mandela Act, is part of a nationwide push to curb widespread use of solitary confinement amid concerns about the mental health ramifications. It would prohibit the practice for pregnant women, those younger than 26, those older than 59, and people with certain disabilities or mental health disorders.For everyone else, stretches in solitary would be limited to 15 consecutive days and 45 days in any 180-day period. Staff workers would also have to periodically check on the confined person and offer out-of-cell programming for at least four hours a day.California’s bill is modeled after one in New York that went into effect this year after a nearly decade-long legislative battle. Colorado, New Jersey, New Mexico and at least 10 other states have also limited or banned punitive segregation, despite objections from corrections officials who argue that such rollbacks will make prisons and jails less safe. Read more about the bill from The New York Times.Under this proposal, law enforcement would gain the ability to strip drivers of their vehicle registration if they don’t fix excessively loud exhaust systems that contribute to noise pollution. Currently, drivers can be ticketed for illegally modified mufflers on cars and motorcycles, but there’s no mechanism to ensure that violators must fix them.This bill would give drivers three months to prove they fixed their exhaust systems, otherwise their vehicle registration could be suspended. Read more from the The Orange County Register.For nearly a decade, California has had a law on the books allowing undocumented residents to get driver’s licenses. This new proposal would allow undocumented Californians who can’t drive to get state-issued IDs.“The only state-issued ID someone with undocumented status can obtain is a driver’s license, blocking a vulnerable portion of the population who are lacking access to a car or the ability to drive from any access to any form of identification,” Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, one of the bill’s co-authors, told The Orange County Register. He added that without an identification card in California, you can’t open a bank account, rent an apartment or a home, or “even cash a hard-earned check.”This bill would allow people convicted of a felony to have their records automatically sealed if they complete all of the terms of their court sentence and remain conviction-free for at least four years. People arrested but not charged with a crime could also have their records sealed.Proponents of the bill say that criminal records haunt people years after they have completed their court-mandated punishments. Read more from The Associated Press.This measure would allow Californians to take someone to civil court over unwanted lewd photos sent to them electronically. The legislation comes after reports of men sending lewd pictures to nearby strangers using the AirDrop iPhone feature or to people through online dating apps without consent from the recipients.The bill applies to senders 18 and older and defines obscene images as anything that depicts a person engaging in sexual acts, including masturbation, or photos of genitals “in a patently offensive way, and that, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.” Read more from The Los Angeles Times.The California county where MAGA took control.Varsity Blues: Jovan Vavic, a former U.S.C. water polo coach who was convicted of bribery as part of the far-reaching Operation Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, was granted a new trial on Thursday.Franzia: Fred Franzia, the businessman who turned the wine industry on its head with his inexpensive Charles Shaw label, better known as Two-Buck Chuck, died on Tuesday at his home in Denair.SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAMudslides: A missing woman who had disappeared amid thunderstorms that caused mudslides in her community in the San Bernardino Mountains was found dead, The Associated Press reports.Los Angeles Times: The newspaper’s owner, Patrick Soon-Shiong, and his daughter face accusations of influencing coverage and endorsements, Politico reports.Censorship: Los Angeles school officials rescinded a suspension against a journalism adviser at Daniel Pearl Magnet High School who had refused to censor an article, The Los Angeles Times reports.Frogs: Rare yellow-legged frogs have been returned to the drought-hammered San Gabriel Mountains, The Los Angeles Times reports.CENTRAL CALIFORNIAOverpass: A new overpass that is part of the Veterans Boulevard project in northwest Fresno will open to traffic on Monday morning, offering a safer way for drivers to cross the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, The Fresno Bee reports.NORTHERN CALIFORNIAWild horses: The Devil’s Garden Colt Challenge, a program where children from across the state adopt and train mustangs, offers a solution to the horses’ overpopulation in California.Rape kit lawsuit: A woman whose DNA from a rape kit was used by the police to arrest her in connection with an unrelated property crime last year filed a federal lawsuit against the city of San Francisco.Sixteen soups our food staff cooks on repeat.Today’s tip comes from Bengisu Ayrancioglu:“My all-time favorite is the Santa Monica Pier and the beach that stretches from Santa Monica to Marina del Rey.

	<title>What to Cook Right Now</title>
	<author>Melissa Clark</author>
	<body>And all of a sudden, the Jewish High Holy Days are nearly upon us. This is how it feels to me every year; just as soon as we settle into our back-to-school routines, it’s time to stop and dip some apples in honey to ensure a sweet new year. Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur are here.In my family, we use the tradition of dipping apples in honey as an excuse to compare the different apple and honey varieties. Do we prefer Braeburns or Mutsus with amber chestnut honey? Are Honeycrisps already sweet enough, or can they take some of New York’s finest rooftop honey slathered on the slices? Our family loves a taste test.Along with those apples, there’s also challah. Usually I bake an orange-scented olive oil loaf that I adapted from Myrna Aronson, but this year I’m going to try Claire Saffitz’s thrilling new raisin-studded challah (above). With the exception of the citrus in Myrna’s recipe and the honey (and optional raisins) in Claire’s, the ingredient list is the same: bread flour, salt, yeast, lots of egg, and olive oil. It’s the technique that’s different.Claire’s method for making a sponge, or preferment, is very smart, yielding a better risen, stretchy dough; it’s easy to form into all manner of fancy, multistrand braids (or to use as the base for a babka). I’m going for the six-strand round version myself. Wish me luck!Also on the sweet side, Joan Nathan has a terrific recipe for a traditional Hungarian honey cake that sandwiches thin gingerbread layer cakes with a filling made from Cream of Wheat and chunky apricot or sour cherry jam. She made it to serve to Steven Fenves, a 91-year-old holocaust survivor, at a dinner in her home. There’s a lovely story, too.Or you can stick with apples as your holiday focus and make Erin Jeanne McDowell’s apple skillet cake with salted caramel frosting or David Tanis’s apple kuchen with honey and ginger.Now that we’ve got dessert sorted out, what else is on your holiday menu? For me, there has to be matzo ball soup. I like Joan Nathan’s straightforward, relatively classic version, enhanced with a touch of fresh ginger. She also has a matzo ball chicken stew for something more rib-sticking — a Jewish iteration of chicken and dumplings. And there’s Fany Gerson’s chile-laden take, spiced with serranos.Then, for the main course, are you in camp chicken (perhaps this sheet-pan chicken with plums) or camp brisket (Susan Spungen’s spice-rubbed version is spectacular)? I’m going rogue this year and contemplating cooking up a pot of fragrant braised lamb shakes with chickpeas, spiced like a tagine. Another out-of-the-box possibility is Diana Henry’s excellent skillet chicken with beans and rice. It would be untraditional, true, but very tasty: easy enough for a weeknight, special enough for a holiday. What’s on your menu? You can let me know at hellomelissa@nytimes.com.Of course, you can make any of these dishes anytime and not just for a holiday. But you do need a subscription for access to the recipes. Won’t you help support our work by subscribing? You can also find us on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, where you can watch Claire Saffitz make her challah and babka recipes. The video is over half an hour long — and worth every minute.Back to the subject of beans and rice: Louis Armstrong liked the dish so much he’d sometimes sign his letters “Red Beans &amp; Ricely Yours.” And yes, to those of you who were about to ask, there IS a recipe.L’shana tova! I’ll see you Wednesday.</body>

	<title>Mexico Has Tequila. Peru, Pisco. In Colombia, a Push for Viche, Now Legal.</title>
	<author>Julie Turkewitz</author>
	<body>CALI, Colombia — As a child, Lucía Solís watched her family bury a stash of cherished but prohibited cane sugar liquor, called viche, in the woods, fearful of police seizures and even arrest.Yet here she was this August surrounded by bottles of various types of viche, its liquid the color of amber or cream or crystal, and she was swamped by customers eager for a now legal taste.She was selling her own brand of the liquor at a stand at one of the largest celebrations of Afro-descendant culture in Latin America, the Petronio Álvarez Pacific Music Festival, where 350,000 visitors turn a broad swath of the city of Cali, Colombia, into a giant party.“Sixth generation!” shouted Ms. Solís, 56, straining to be heard over the sounds of deep bass drums and melodic marimba as she explained that she was just one in a long line of women to produce viche. “My grandmother, my great-grandmother, my great-great-grandmother. The ancestors!”Viche, made of distilled sugar cane, was invented by formerly enslaved people in the region around Colombia’s Pacific Coast and gained popularity as the homegrown response to the monopoly held by the government on cane liquor — becoming a sort of Colombian moonshine.It is distinct from other cane sugar liquors, including Colombian aguardiente, because the sugar cane must be grown next to the sea or a river and alongside other crops native to the region that producers say give viche its distinct smoky-citrus taste.Outlawed for generations, viche (pronounced VEE-chey) became a symbol of the longstanding exclusion of Black culture from Colombia’s national narrative — its ban further evidence, according to critics, that the country was failing to recognize the community’s many contributions.The Petronio Álvarez festival is a powerful response to any attempt to ignore or dismiss Colombia’s Afro-descendant culture. Named after a musician who celebrated that culture in his songs, it began in 1997 as a music event and has grown into a blend of a regional reunion, fashion week, a series of master chef contests, a dance festival and one of the most important concerts of the year.For some, annual attendance is tradition, akin to a cultural pilgrimage. (Petronio, as the event is commonly called, went virtual in 2020 amid the pandemic, and took place in a reduced format last year.)The festival itself takes place inside an open-air sports complex, where a music contest that is sort of the Colombian Idol of the Pacific Coast this year awarded one of its biggest prizes to the band La Jagua.But its legendary after-party spills into Cali’s streets, and this year there was a special appearance by Francia Márquez, the country’s first Afro-Colombian vice president, who, fresh off a series of visits with South American presidents, appeared on a balcony, waving and blowing kisses to a crowd chanting her name.After generations in which Black Colombians were mostly excluded from the highest echelons of national politics, Ms. Márquez’s recent political rise — she was born into deep poverty, then became a lawyer and environmental activist before winning the vice presidency — has electrified many voters.At the festival, Afro-Colombian food and drink is an essential part of the scene, and viche is the only alcohol permitted at the event. Vendors attempting to sell beer are escorted away by security.Viche’s elevated role at the festival is all the more remarkable considering its outlaw history.But in 2019, the country’s Constitutional Court ruled that a law providing protection for ancestral beverages in Indigenous communities must also apply to Afro-Colombian ones. This paved the way for Congress to legalize viche and declare it the collective heritage of the Afro-Pacific people.Last year, viche was granted status as a cultural heritage product.Now, Ms. Solís and others are part of a push to convince Colombians beyond the Pacific to embrace viche as a cultural emblem of the entire country.“Mexico has tequila, Peru has pisco, Scotland has whisky,” said Manuel Pineda, president of the regional chapter of the Colombian Association of Bars. “We have viche.”The aim, he said, is to ultimately go global.“It is very important for us to respect those grandparents who brought it to this moment,” he said. “But we want the world to know this story.”The festival’s prevailing mood is one of exuberance and cultural pride, and attendees of all races and ethnicities are welcome.Viche is everywhere. In bottles at small stands. Poured into plastic sample cups. Sold out of coolers at concerts. Tucked into pockets and backpacks. Passed among new friends. Celebrated in an entire pavilion with more than 50 viche-producing families, called vicheras.At the first-ever Petronio viche cocktail contest, the winner was a mix of viche, sherry, orange-basil liqueur, lime juice and coca leaf.The liquor is in the lyrics of the wildly popular hip-hop trio ChocQuibTown, which on a summer Saturday night filled an enormous plaza in Cali, opening their set with a song called “Somos Pacífico” — meaning both “we are peaceful” and “we are the Pacific.” Even police officers were shaking their hips.Viche is commonly mixed with herbs, fruits and spices. One version called tomaseca has rich notes of cinnamon and nutmeg; another, arrechón, creamy and smooth from the borojó fruit, is considered an aphrodisiac. Curao is infused with herbs like mint, chamomile or pipilongo, a plant native to the region.“A drink so charged with symbolism, with values, seems delicious to me,” said Neila Castillo, 68, who stood by Ms. Solís’s stand, sampling viches with a college friend, Marta Espinosa, 67. They tucked bottles of clear white viche puro into their bags to enjoy later.In 2008, viche became the festival’s official drink when organizers made the bold decision to market it during the event as part of an “awareness exercise,” even though it was still illegal, said Ana Copete, the festival’s director and granddaughter of its namesake. At the time, viche was granted informal protection under the framework of the event, she said, and vendors were allowed to sell their products without interference from the authorities.Viche represents the only income for many families in the Pacific region of Colombia, and in 2018, Ms. Copete launched a collaborative effort with producers and local organizations to put viche legalization on the public agenda.The group soon secured support from Colombia’s Ministry of Culture and other policymakers who saw the economic potential of the beverage.“It has been a struggle to keep it alive, to keep the tradition from disappearing,” Ms. Copete said. Its prominent presence at the festival, she added, “allows other people who are not from the Pacific to know this drink and to know what it represents, to consume it — that helps the vichera families.”Ms. Solís, the viche producer, grew up with the drink as part of daily life in Buenaventura, a Pacific port city about 70 miles from Cali. It was taken not only as a spirit but also as a traditional medicine used to aid childbirth, cleanse wounds, soothe menstrual cramps and treat infertility.When she was 7, her aunt told her that she was going to instruct her in local knowledge more than 300 years old. She would cover the child’s eyes with a scarf and teach her to identify plants only by their fragrance.Ms. Solís was one of the first vicheras to have her company, Seeds of Life, registered with the country’s commerce authority, even before it was declared an “intangible cultural heritage of the nation.”When she found out about the registration, she cried, jumped, shouted, hugged her son and gave thanks to God. The feeling, she said, was indescribable.Legalizing and honoring viche, she said, “was a tremendous joy because it is a struggle of many.”</body>

	<title>Wall Street Is on Edge as It Tries to Guess What the Fed Is Thinking</title>
	<author>Joe Rennison</author>
	<body>Will Jay Powell be hawkish or dovish when the Federal Reserve meets on Wednesday? The collective mood of investors going forward, already soured after last week’s stock market tumult, depends on the answer to that question.It will come as no surprise to Wall Street if the Fed delivers another bumper interest rate increase as it seeks to temper hotter-than-expected inflation. Nor will it be a surprise if the central bank’s economic projections foretell that the dark cloud hovering over the markets is unlikely to lift soon. Prominent investors and business leaders have already sounded the alarm.Instead, the focus is likely to be on Mr. Powell’s comments, parsed for clues as to where the Fed chief expects the economy and interest rates — and, consequently, financial markets — to go.The Fed’s meeting is important “because of what it could mean for the direction of the stock market for the rest of the year,” said Kristina Hooper, the chief global market strategist at Invesco. “The Fed has been the key driver of the stock market this year, and it has been mostly bad.”If Mr. Powell appears “hawkish” — calling for more restraint for the economy through higher interest rates, even if it means risking recession — stock prices will probably sink lower. But if he is seen as unexpectedly “dovish,” suggesting that inflation is under control and that lowering interest rates may soon become appropriate, financial markets are likely to be more cheerful.Market observers are not holding their breath.“He cannot sound dovish. He will not sound dovish,” said Mark Cabana, an interest rate strategist at Bank of America. “He will sound very much as someone who is committed to ensuring price stability and doing whatever it takes to achieve that.”The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.7 percent on Monday, after wobbling between small gains and losses throughout the trading session. The benchmark stock index was coming off one of its worst weeks of the year, when it fell nearly 5 percent. Already, it had been a volatile summer of trading, during which a stock market rally proved short-lived as investors became less optimistic that the economy would look better in the coming months.One driver for the dour mood in markets is the recent release of data from the Consumer Price Index, the most widely used gauge of inflation, that suggests prices remain more elevated than expected. Consumer prices rose 8.3 percent over the year through August, down from 8.5 percent over the year through July but above the 8.1 percent that economists expected. Crucially, month-to-month price changes inched up.As a result, investors expect that the Fed will need to raise interest rates higher and faster than they once thought, to slow down the economy and rein in prices. But the flip side is that companies and consumers face higher costs.The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, rose on Monday to 3.95 percent, hitting its highest point since 2007 and continuing a remarkable run since the start of the year, when it was under 0.75 percent. Rising yields flow through to mortgages, credit cards, business loans and other borrowing costs, crimping economic activity.Most investors still expect the Fed to stick to a 0.75- percentage-point increase on Wednesday based on prices for futures, which indicate investors’ expectations for rate increases. A small number of investors, however, are betting on a full-point increase, which would be the Fed’s biggest since 1984 and probably result in stocks lurching lower.Last week, analysts at Nomura predicted that the Fed would raise rates by one percentage point, saying the stubbornly high inflation numbers require a more “forceful” response from policymakers.Other central banks have taken similar steps, or are considering them. The Bank of Canada raised interest rates by one percentage point in July. Some bankers forecast that the Riksbank, the Swedish central bank, could raise rates by one percentage point on Tuesday.And while most investors still expect a three-quarter-point boost from the Fed on Wednesday, the futures market shows that investors have rapidly adjusted to the idea that more interest rate increases are to come, expecting a peak between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent next year, before falling toward the end of the year.To get a closer read — and not from Mr. Powell’s comments — investors will also look for changes in the Fed’s “dot plot,” the name given to the collection of dots created by plotting the interest rate forecasts of individual policymakers on a chart. In particular, they will look for signs that the Fed is willing to keep interest rates elevated to tackle inflation, even as they forecast slowing economic growth, raising the risk of the economy’s slipping into a recession.“That’s the ugly scenario,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Capital Management. “That’s the signal, in theory, that the Federal Reserve is prioritizing inflation above economic growth and will do so for a while.”</body>

	<title>Volkswagen Sets Price Range for Porsche’s Blockbuster I.P.O.</title>
	<author>Michael J. de la Merced</author>
	<body>Volkswagen said late Sunday that it planned to sell shares in Porsche, the luxury sports car brand it owns, at a valuation of up to $75 billion, setting the stage for one of the biggest stock market debuts of the year.At that level, Porsche — maker of the 911 sports car and the Taycan electric sedan — would be valued at a higher level than German rivals like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.The offering of Porsche on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, months in the making, comes as volatile stock markets have chilled interest in initial public offerings. If the stock sale is completed, Porsche’s public offering will be one of the largest ever in Europe, according to Refinitiv.It would return Porsche to the public markets for the first time in a decade, after Volkswagen bought the sports car maker following a failed effort by Porsche to buy the much larger Volkswagen. Since then, Porsche had become one of Volkswagen’s most prized brands, reporting 3.6 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in operating profit in the first half of the year.The companies, whose decades-old histories are deeply intertwined, will retain strong ties after the stock offering. Volkswagen will keep a majority stake in Porsche, and the two automakers will share a chief executive, Oliver Blume.Volkswagen said in a statement that it aimed to sell about 25 percent of Porsche’s preferred shares at €76.50 to €82.50, potentially yielding as much as €9.4 billion in proceeds. Volkswagen has already secured as investors in the offering the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Norway and Abu Dhabi, as well as the money-management firm T. Rowe Price.And the Porsche and Piëch families — which trace their roots to the founding of Porsche and are collectively Volkswagen’s biggest shareholder — have agreed to buy a 12.5 percent stake in Porsche at 7.5 percent more than the offering’s price.That could yield as much as €10.1 billion more for Volkswagen. Unlike the preferred shares being sold in the public offering, the voting stock that the families would receive would give them a significant say in the way Porsche is run.About half the total proceeds from the public offering would be paid out as a special dividend to Volkswagen shareholders. The remainder, executives have said, would help pay for Volkswagen’s shift to electric vehicles, including the construction of new vehicle batteries.Trading in Porsche is expected to begin on Sept. 29.</body>

	<title>Word of the Day: attenuate</title>
	<author>The Learning Network</author>
	<body>verb: become weaker, in strength, value, or magnitudeverb: weaken the consistency of (a chemical substance)adjective: reduced in strengthThe word attenuate has appeared 48 times on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Oct. 26 in the Wirecutter article “Don’t Call It a Comeback: Cassettes Have Sounded Lousy for Years (And Still Do!)” by Brent Butterworth:When it comes to audio, there are always those who insist that the old is better than the new, but with cassettes, that’s a tough claim to back. As I found a few years ago, when I ran a bunch of technical measurements on high-end cassette decks, cassettes couldn’t come close to the quality of CDs.…. Cassettes, on the other hand, start to attenuate bass tones below about 40 Hz, so instruments with ultra-deep notes — such as grand piano, large kick drums, and synth bass — lose some of their sonic power. Cassettes often damp treble tones above about 10 kHz, which means the upper harmonics of instruments like cymbals, flutes, and violins are lost, along with some of the sense of spaciousness that makes live recordings sound live. Compared with the quality of CDs, the sound from cassettes tends to be dull and somewhat lifeless.Can you correctly use the word attenuate in a sentence?Based on the definition and example provided, write a sentence using today’s Word of the Day and share it as a comment on this article.

	<title>Law Enforcement Funding Package Splits Democrats Ahead of Midterm Elections</title>
	<author>Stephanie Lai</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Legislation to increase funding for local police departments has hit a snag on Capitol Hill amid deep Democratic divisions, as progressives balk at steering more money to law enforcement and moderates clamor for action that could blunt Republicans’ efforts to paint them as soft on crime ahead of the midterm elections.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has pledged for weeks to bring up a package of bills that would provide funding for hiring more police officers, increasing salaries and investing in officer safety and training and body cameras, as well as mental health resources for officers.But the measures, championed by vulnerable Democrats from conservative-leaning districts, have become mired in a yearslong internal feud about the politics of crime, leaving the party without an answer to Republican attacks and some of its members livid.“I have heard a whole host of reasons for people wanting to excuse inaction,” said Representative Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia, who is in a difficult re-election race in a competitive district that includes the suburbs of Richmond, and is a lead proponent of the legislation. “The sort of generalized excuses — I’ve heard it a lot. Tomorrow it will be, ‘It’s raining.’”Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, who pressed successfully for the package to include measures to strengthen accountability for police misconduct, have also pushed to move ahead with it.A spokesman for the caucus said that the issue remains a priority for the group.Yet a small group of progressives has so far refused to back the legislation, leaving Democrats short of the votes they would need to bring it up. House Democratic leaders do not want to put their party’s divisions on display at a time when the political map is looking more favorable for them than it did just a few months ago. So Ms. Pelosi has been holding off on announcing any vote, as lawmakers continue discussions with those withholding their support.Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has positioned herself as the principal roadblock to the legislation, arguing that it would provide a blank check to police departments.“The answer is not just putting more money in,” Ms. Jayapal said. “I’m not sure that this has a chance of moving forward, given all of the challenges around it.”Because of Democrats’ slim majority in the House, the opposition of Ms. Jayapal and just three other liberals would be enough to block it from proceeding to a vote. Talks among her, moderate Democrats and party leaders were continuing on Monday, according to a person familiar with the negotiations, with some still hopeful for a potential breakthrough.Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, has been pushing for a vote on the measure this week, a second person familiar with the talks said.Yet time is running short for Democrats to act before the midterm elections, in which Republicans have once again made crime a major point of attack. With the legislation languishing, vulnerable Democrats are losing out on a potential political boost from passing a pro-police bill. There is little time remaining before November to campaign on such a vote or to produce an advertisement attempting to claim credit.Republicans have tried for years to portray Democrats as soft on crime and bent on defunding the police — a mantra that many progressives embraced amid a series of high-profile cases of excessive violence by law enforcement, particularly against people of color.The Republican criticism has sharpened around election time, including in recent weeks, as gas prices have fallen and the party has searched for other ways to tarnish Democrats in the eyes of suburban voters, such as spotlighting the dysfunctional immigration system and the continuing toll of inflation.How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.Before the 2018 midterm elections, President Donald J. Trump branded Democrats the “party of crime,” even though crime rates had risen in cities with leaders of both political parties. Since 2019, murders have spiked by nearly 40 percent, and violent crimes, including shootings and other assaults, have increased overall.The drama that is playing out now is the latest chapter in a long-running fight about the issue among Democrats. After the party’s disappointing results in the 2020 midterm elections, as Democrats bickered internally about what had gone wrong, Ms. Spanberger privately vented her frustration about progressive colleagues who had embraced the “defund the police” movement, arguing that Democrats had to push back much more forcefully against Republican efforts to caricature them as anti-law enforcement.At the time, progressives including Ms. Jayapal angrily rejected the criticism, arguing that they had helped to turn out the party’s liberal base by speaking to the issues that animated core supporters, including people of color, allowing Democrats to hold the House majority.Those pressing to pass the legislation this year argue that it goes beyond politics and would make communities safer by helping police departments focus on community-oriented approaches. And they have tried to address broad concerns among Democrats about including meaningful police accountability measures.Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey, has introduced the Invest to Protect Act, which would direct the Justice Department to award grants to local or tribal governments with fewer than 200 law enforcement officers to improve recruitment, purchase body cameras and provide de-escalation training.“We have to make it clear to the country that we’re a party that’s tough on crime and supports protecting our communities and those who do,” Mr. Gottheimer said.Mr. Hoyer said in a recent letter to Democrats that the House would be “ready to consider” the legislation this month.“Democrats are not for defunding the police,” Mr. Hoyer told reporters, adding that party members had voted for police funding. “We voted for it in the last budget, the budget before that, and every budget since I’ve been here to make sure that law enforcement have the resources it needed.”Civil rights groups including the N.A.A.C.P.  are making the case that additional police funding must be paired with accountability measures.“A wealth of evidence supports the fact that certain preventative measures, such as violence prevention programs and other community investments, can dramatically improve safety outcomes,” the organization wrote in a letter to Democratic leaders last month.But with the legislative calendar dwindling, many pressing for action said they remained skeptical there would be any real effort to move forward.“I keep hearing from leadership, ‘We really want to bring these bills,’ ” Ms. Spanberger said. “And yet.”Democrats had originally hoped to vote on the police funding bills over the summer and were planning to pair them with legislation to ban assault weapons that passed in July, before lawmakers left Washington for their August recess. But when disagreements emerged about accountability measures in the police bills, Ms. Pelosi chose to move ahead with just the assault weapons ban and revisit the law enforcement legislation in the fall.Now the House is back, but the police funding issue has not yet been settled.Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York, said she recognized the need for additional police funding, but still had reservations that the measures lacked sufficient accountability measures for law enforcement, which she described as “a tacit acceptance of abusive behaviors.”“It’s important that we have the personnel in place to make sure that our cities are safe,” Ms. Clarke said. “We also need to make sure that there’s the proper training in place, so that communities of color feel like they’re in partnership with their police departments.”Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Five Years Later, Fiona Brings Back Painful Memories of Maria.</title>
	<author>Daniel Victor</author>
	<body>Hurricane Fiona’s arrival in Puerto Rico came almost exactly five years after Hurricane Maria struck, a devastating storm from which the island never fully recovered.On Sept. 20, 2017, Maria landed in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, producing as much as 40 inches of rainfall. It caused the deaths of roughly 3,000 people, bringing devastation, property damage and the destruction of infrastructure in every corner of the island.But its lasting impact was just beginning.Public fury bubbled up at the government’s response to the storm; a 2018 report found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had been unprepared for a disaster on the scale of Maria, which was one of three storms to hit the United States in quick succession in 2017. It described a chaotic and disorganized relief effort on the island that was plagued by logistical problems.Years on, housing still hadn’t been found for tens of thousands of survivors still living under leaky tarps, while others lived in wrecked homes. A grass-roots movement channeling the anger formed, fueling a popular uprising in 2019 that lasted 15 days and led to former Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló stepping down.Five years later, unreliable electricity remained a fact of life on the island.“I think all of us Puerto Ricans who lived through Maria have that post-traumatic stress of, ‘What is going to happen, how long is it going to last and what needs might we face?’” Danny Hernández, who works in San Juan, told The Associated Press while he was stocking up with supplies.</body>

	<title>Don’t Let Republicans Off the Hook on Same-Sex Marriage</title>
	<author>Pamela Paul</author>
	<body>Why is it always on the Democrats to compromise?To be the nice ones? To take the high road to nowhere?On Thursday, the bipartisan group of senators behind the Respect for Marriage Act, which would enshrine federal protections for same-sex marriage, announced a delay in putting the measure to a vote, which had been expected to take place this week.According to the bill’s lead sponsor, Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, postponing the vote until after the November elections would increase the likelihood of getting the 10 Republicans on board necessary to push it through today’s filibustery Senate, where 60 votes would be needed for it to advance.Baldwin, and Democrats generally, are essentially conceding that it will be hard to get Republicans to commit to a measure that’s anathema to their base before the midterm elections. That in the interest of actually passing the bill, as opposed to putting Republicans on the record with an unpopular, anti-same-sex-marriage vote, Democrats should be generous and allow Republicans more time to muster support.Really? We’re supposed to believe it will be easier to bring Republicans on board after the election? If the Democrats retain the Senate postelection, Republicans will have little reason to vote against their base. If the Republicans retake the Senate, they’ll have less incentive still.Please. This just makes things easier on Republican lawmakers: A vote would force them to dissatisfy either swing voters, with whom same-sex marriage is highly popular, or their extremist base, with whom (to put it mildly) it is not. Easier for Republicans to scurry away from a proposal that’s politically risky, just as they did earlier last week with Lindsey Graham’s unpopular bill on abortion. And they’re doing this at the expense of the many Americans in same-sex relationships — married, engaged or on the cusp of commitment — for whom this just makes life harder and more precarious.This is exactly the moment to hold Republicans’ feet to the fire. It’s the moment for those Republicans who are in favor of gay marriage to stand up for what has become a clear majority position in the country, or to cave spectacularly to the prejudices of their base. As Senator Elizabeth Warren put it: “Every single member of Congress should be willing to go on the record. And if there are Republicans who don’t want to vote on that before the election, I assume it is because they are on the wrong side of history.”Maybe they are, and maybe they aren’t. They could be true believers, or they could simply be selling their souls in the interest of staying in office. But those who do support gay marriage need to act. Particularly given the ominous words of Clarence Thomas’s concurring opinion on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which many interpreted as a threat to revisit the landmark 2015 decision establishing the right to same-sex marriage.If that right is no longer settled law, as had previously been assumed, it’s certainly a settled moral principle. Over the past seven short years and following the course of many long ones, same-sex marriage has reached the status of a basic and bedrock civil right. Currently, 71 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage. This not only includes the vast majority of Democrats but, as of 2021, 55 percent of Republicans, according to Gallup. That is the definition of bipartisan consensus.In theory, I’m as much in favor of bipartisanship as the next pragmatist, despite the consistent battering the practice has gotten, especially from Obama’s failed efforts to woo Republicans on the Affordable Care Act onward. It’s hard to hold much hope in the ideal.When it comes to polarizing culture war issues, gay marriage may be the most unifying policy there is. Even under the capacious L.G.B.T.Q. umbrella, where disparate issues around sexual orientation, gay rights and gender identity split Americans across the political spectrum, you can’t get much closer to consensus than same-sex marriage. It may be the one clear-cut policy here that unites people rather than divides them.Alas, and unsurprisingly, it was Republican senators who requested the delay. According to Politico, a number of Republican senators complained that if Chuck Schumer forced a vote on the measure on Monday, they’d view it as politically motivated. As if delaying the vote for explicitly political reasons wasn’t politically motivated?What’s on Democrats here is the failure, once again, to play hardball — in the same way Republicans have done repeatedly and without remorse. To take just one recent and brazen example, Republicans pushed through a vote on Amy Coney Barrett days before an election, despite Democrats’ simmering fury over the Senate majority leader at the time, Mitch McConnell, refusing to even consider Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination eight months before an election.Instead, Democrats are effectively joining Republicans in putting politics ahead of principle — and purely on behalf of Republicans. If politics were remotely fair play, Republicans would return the favor by voting overwhelmingly in favor of the Respect for Marriage Act during the post-midterm lame-duck session.Who here is holding their breath?The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Earthquake Shakes Mexico on Anniversary of 2 Major Temblors</title>
	<author>The Associated Press</author>
	<body>MEXICO CITY — A magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook Mexico’s central Pacific coast on Monday, killing at least two people, damaging thousands of structures and setting off a seismic alarm in the rattled capital on the anniversary of two earlier devastating quakes.The quake hit at 1:05 p.m. local time, according to the U.S. Geologic Survey. It said the quake was centered 23 miles southeast of Aquila near the boundary of Colima and Michoacan states at a depth of 9.4 miles.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said via Twitter that the secretary of the navy had told him that one person was killed in the port city of Manzanillo, Colima, when a wall at a mall collapsed.Later, a woman also died in Manzanillo after being severely injured when a wall collapsed, Laura Velázquez, head of federal Civil Protection, local news outlets reported on Tuesday. Nine others were injured in Colima, and 26 received hospital care in Coahuayana, a municipality in the neighboring state of Michoacán.In Coalcomán, Michoacan, near the quake’s epicenter, buildings were damaged, including a hospital, according to local residents, but there were no immediate reports of injuries.Mexico City’s mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, tweeted that there were no reports of damage in the capital, but power was out in parts of the city, including stoplights, snarling the capital’s traffic.Alarms for the new quake came less than an hour after quake alarms warbled in a nationwide earthquake simulation marking major, deadly quakes that struck on the same date in 1985 and 2017.“This is a coincidence,” that this is the third Sept. 19 earthquake, said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Paul Earle. “There’s no physical reason or statistical bias toward earthquakes in any given month in Mexico.”Humberto Garza stood outside a restaurant in Mexico City’s Roma neighborhood holding his 3-year-old son. Like many milling about outside after the earthquake, Mr. Garza said that the real earthquake alarm sounded so soon after the annual simulation that he was not sure it was genuine.“I heard the alarm, but it sounded really far away,” he said.</body>

	<title>‘One Foot in the Present, One Foot in the Past:’ Understanding E.M.D.R.</title>
	<author>Dani Blum</author>
	<body>Trauma shoves a mind into overdrive. The brain tries to block out fragments of disaster: the spray of shattered glass as one car slammed into another, the smell of smoke. People with post-traumatic stress disorder sometimes constrict their lives, avoiding streets or smells or songs that make them think about what they’ve experienced. But memories make themselves known — in nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts.Since PTSD was first included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1980, clinicians have identified a handful of therapies that help people cope with traumatic memories. Over the past decade, a seemingly unconventional treatment has wedged its way into mainstream therapy.Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, better known as E.M.D.R., might look bizarre to an observer. The practice involves coaxing people to process traumatic memories while simultaneously interacting with images, sounds or sensations that activate both sides of the brain. Patients might flit their eyes back and forth, following a therapist’s finger or stare at bursts of light on alternating sides of a screen. The idea is to anchor the brain in the current moment as a patient recalls the past.In recent years, E.M.D.R. has attracted more attention, thanks in part to increased demand for trauma treatment throughout the pandemic and celebrities who have shared their experiences. Prince Harry filmed an E.M.D.R. session for a documentary series with Oprah. Sandra Bullock said she turned to E.M.D.R. after a stalker broke into her home in 2014; “The Good Place” actress Jameela Jamil wrote in a 2019 Instagram post that E.M.D.R. “saved my life.”Patients who seek out E.M.D.R. may be inspired by another source: “The Body Keeps the Score,” a seminal book on trauma that has stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for over 200 weeks. Bessel van der Kolk, the book’s author, touts the treatment as one of the most effective ways to combat PTSD symptoms. “It’s not really an innovative treatment anymore,” he said. “It’s something that’s very well-established.”The psychologist Francine Shapiro developed E.M.D.R. in 1987 as she grappled with her own disturbing memory — first, experimenting on herself, flitting her eyes back and forth as she walked through a park, and then gradually expanding the treatment to other people.Therapists carry out E.M.D.R. in eight phases that typically unfold over six to 12 sessions, although that number varies from person to person. Each session tends to last between 60 and 90 minutes. First, a therapist will discuss the patient’s current challenges, gathering information about their history, and then propose a plan for treatment, said Deborah Korn, a clinician and co-author of “Every Memory Deserves Respect.”The patient may need to “float back” from their current symptoms, she said, exploring a recent emotional outburst or panic attack to isolate the triggers that provoked it. The goal is to identify a traumatic memory that a patient can work through in the later E.M.D.R. phases.“Most people don’t show up saying ‘I want to work on my traumatic memories from ages 5 to 11,’” Dr. Korn said. “They say, ‘I’m miserable.’”Then, the patient and clinician devise coping strategies, like breathing exercises or meditation to help combat dissociation, that a patient can use if they become distressed during or between sessions.Once those strategies are established, typically after one or two sessions, the therapist instructs the patient to recall the most difficult aspect of the traumatic event. It could be an image, sound or smell that intrudes on their thoughts most often; for some patients, the most vivid memory related to a trauma took place just before an event transpired, said Sanne Houben, a researcher at Maastricht University who studies E.M.D.R.Patients focus on the sensations and emotions they experience while thinking about this aspect as they engage in activities like moving their eyes, tapping on their body or hearing a faint beeping sound that alternates between their ears. Each set of these bilateral stimulations typically lasts between 30 and 60 seconds.Periodically, the therapist will ask the patient what they are noticing or feeling, encouraging them to consider the memory from a present-day perspective. “If you say, ‘It’s all my fault,’ a therapist might ask how old were you, did you really think you could protect yourself as a child?” said Vaile Wright, the senior director of health care innovation at the American Psychological Association. “It’s not just that you sit there and think about the memory.”Pushing a patient to deliberately revisit the past isn’t a feature of just E.M.D.R.; most therapies for PTSD, including prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, prompt patients to “actively go toward the trauma,” said Dr. Shaili Jain, a PTSD specialist at Stanford University.Revisiting trauma can activate the body’s stress response — cortisol levels spike and heart rate jumps. But over time, the process can gradually desensitize you to your memories, habituating your body to the stress and anxiety you experience when confronted with a reminder of the trauma.“That fight or flight response just gets brought down several notches, so you’re back in the driver's seat of your life,” Dr. Jain said. “Instead of ricocheting off triggers.”With E.M.D.R., the added component of bilateral stimulation theoretically anchors the patient in the current moment as they’re engaging with a trauma. “We use the phrase: one foot in the present, and one foot in the past,” said Marianne Silva, a clinical social worker and E.M.D.R. practitioner at the V.A. New England Healthcare System.The bilateral stimulation needs to be compelling enough to distract patients, but not so overwhelming that they totally focus on it. Multiplication tables, for instance, would require too much effort, said Richard McNally, a psychology professor at Harvard University.Our brains do not have the capacity to completely focus on both the bilateral stimulation and the traumatic memory, Dr. Houben said. The theory behind E.M.D.R. is that memories become less vivid and emotional when a patient can’t focus on them completely.“At the end of a therapy session, you put it back in storage,” Dr. McNally said. “It’s in a degraded form. It’s not quite as emotionally evocative.”Today, clinicians generally consider E.M.D.R. an effective treatment for trauma. The World Health Organization and American Psychological Association have recommended it for people with PTSD and have issued guidelines for administering treatment. In England, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, a rigorous authority in the psychological field, lists E.M.D.R. as a tool for adults grappling with trauma and children who have not responded to trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy.But scientists are debating whether E.M.D.R. is more effective than other trauma treatment methods. Pim Cuijpers, a professor of clinical psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, analyzed nearly 80 studies on E.M.D.R. and found that, while the research pointed to the treatment’s positive effects, “the quality of research is really very bad,” he said.Many psychological treatments lack rigorous studies, he said, but the evidence for E.M.D.R. was particularly thin, with small sample sizes and potential bias on the part of clinicians conducting the research.While E.M.D.R. is most likely effective, Dr. Cuijpers said, he cautioned against wholeheartedly endorsing the evidence behind the treatment.And there are very few studies that show E.M.D.R. works in the long-term, said Henry Otgaar, a researcher and professor of forensic psychology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands.Dr. Otgaar, Dr. Houben and other researchers are investigating whether E.M.D.R. increases a patient’s susceptibility to false memories. While creating false memories is a risk in many therapies, Dr. Houben said “it’s too early to say if that’s inherent to E.M.D.R.”When E.M.D.R. started becoming more widely publicized in the late 90s and early 2000s, Dr. McNally, then a trauma researcher, was one of the most outspoken critics against the treatment — writing that E.M.D.R. was “merely one of the many therapeutic fuzz-balls that litter the landscape of psychology today,” in an issue of the Journal of Anxiety Disorders. He acknowledged that E.M.D.R. can desensitize people to their memories, but did not think there was convincing evidence that the most distinctive feature of the therapy — the eye movements — had any additional benefit. Today, the issue of whether processing trauma with a therapist would lead to similar results remains up for debate; Dr. Jain calls it “the multimillion dollar question.”Still, there are patients and clinicians who swear by the treatment — and enough “solid data” to back it, Dr. Jain said. Patients report fewer PTSD symptoms after sessions, Dr. Wright said, with fewer flashbacks and intrusive thoughts.“Anybody who has experienced trauma” could benefit from E.M.D.R., said Trisha Miller, a psychotherapist at the Cleveland Clinic. People with mental health conditions beyond PTSD, like depression, eating disorders, phobias and addictions may also benefit from E.M.D.R., she added, although there is not yet robust research confirming that the treatment is effective for those conditions.People seeking E.M.D.R. practitioners should make sure they find a certified specialist, Ms. Miller stressed. The E.M.D.R. International Association, which runs certification and training for the therapy, keeps a directory of practitioners who have been trained and certified by the organization.“From a clinician’s perspective, I’m like, ‘whatever works,’” Dr. Jain said. “If E.M.D.R. works for you, do it.”</body>

	<title>Nissan Recalls Over 203,000 Pickups That May Roll Away While Parked</title>
	<author>April Rubin</author>
	<body>Nissan has voluntarily recalled more than 203,000 of its pickup truck models because of a defect that can cause the vehicles to roll away while in park, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.More than 203,000 Nissan Titan and Frontier vehicles with nine-speed transmissions are involved, according to a report this month from the administration.The affected vehicles were produced between Dec. 13, 2019, and Aug. 25, 2022. The vehicles are in markets in the United States, Canada and Mexico, said Stephen O’Neil, a Nissan spokesman.“Nissan will send owners of affected Titan and Frontier vehicles a letter with an invitation to repair when a final remedy plan is available,” he said.The issue is believed to be caused by insufficient lifting force of the parking pawl, a device that locks the transmission. Friction between the parking rod and parking wedge contributed to the defect.The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the recall, Mr. O’Neil said. Drivers of these trucks are advised to use the parking brake.“If the parking pawl does not engage, an affected vehicle may move after placing the shifter into ‘Park,’” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report said. “If the customer does not engage the parking brake, potential for movement of the vehicle increases the risk of injury or crash.”The company is determining if other Nissan or Infiniti vehicles may be affected, the report said.In June, Nissan issued a separate recall of Titan and Frontier models manufactured between December 2019 and June 2022 “due to potential non-engagement of the parking pawl,” the administration report said. A Nissan plant in Mississippi reported in July that a vehicle moved after being placed in park. This defect appeared to be different from the one in the June recall, according to the administration’s September report.“Nissan’s investigation is ongoing, and the final recall remedy is still under development,” the administration report said.In June, Ford issued a recall for about three million vehicles over similar rollaway concerns. In that case, a safety recall report said “heat and humidity have the potential to contribute to the hydrological breakdown of the bushing material.”Drivers can check on the administration’s website if a recall has been issued for their vehicle by entering the 17-digit vehicle identification number.</body>

	<title>Burnout, Productivity and Other Tales of the Office</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>To the Editor:Re “‘Quiet Quitting’ Is Not the Solution to Burnout,” by Laura Vanderkam (Sunday Opinion, Sept. 18):Ms. Vanderkam misses another key alternative to “quiet quitting”: returning to the office.We’ve always had burnout, and returning to the office won’t solve that for everyone. But part of the burnout we’re feeling is a lack of stimulation.My job is fully remote, but I recently started at a co-working space to break up the monotony of working from home. Even my bike ride to and from work is the active, effortful break I need to engage more meaningfully in my work.I’m jealous of the people who have an office to return to, and managers who are encouraging them to come back in. It’s an opportunity that I’d certainly take.Abigail ConyersBoulder, Colo.To the Editor:“So You Wanted to Get Work Done at the Office?” (Business, Sept. 12) says office distractions are detrimental to productivity. That’s right, but working at home can be unproductive, too.After two years of isolation during the pandemic, I cannot overemphasize the disadvantages of working remotely. It creates a natural sense of isolation; what could have been a short talk becomes a long string of emails and misunderstandings. Collaboration in general becomes unnecessarily difficult.Working alone means it’s important to have a strong sense of self-regulation. Being away from a shared work space allows for an unrestricted number of breaks, resulting in less work time.After being in the same environment all day, it’s hard to not continue thinking about work and to draw a distinct line between work, family and personal downtime.Zichang (Amanda) WangHerndon, Va.To the Editor:Re “The Immortal Awfulness of Open Plan Workplaces,” by David Brooks (column, Sept. 9):I agree with Mr. Brooks that open-plan office spaces don’t work, although he talks mostly about productivity and the effects on employees’ mental health.My issue with the lack of privacy is that everyone can overhear your private calls. Many years ago, when I worked in such an office, my biggest complaint was that there was no place to call and have a confidential conversation with my doctor. There were no cellphones then, but I imagine that people have this same issue today.Many businesses can be reached only during office hours, and they may be businesses that you don’t want your co-worker to know about. Correcting billing mistakes, medical issues, calls from the school: These calls compound stress, knowing that people you work with now know your personal problems.If a company does insist on an open plan, it should at least offer some small rooms (not the conference room) where people can make and take some private calls.Amy McCormacLos AngelesTo the Editor:Office workers choosing to work at home, and David Brooks, are telling us that open-plan offices are not a one-size-fits-all solution to our office needs.Office productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. Research on office design is often based on small samples and not subject to easy replication. There is little research funding for this work. Models other than open-plan office are seldom studied. Strikingly, major furniture manufacturers have both directly and indirectly contributed to this research, often supporting their open-office systems.Office space is an investment. Ironically, open-office schemes fabled for crowding do not always use less space than private-office schemes. Evidence suggests that daylight, fresh air, views, quiet and privacy are key to supporting human well-being and performance.Christie Johnson CoffinBerkeley, Calif.The writer is an architect and an author.To the Editor:“Parties Agree on U.S. Crisis, but Not Cause” (news analysis, front page, Sept. 3) does a superb job detailing the divide between Americans regarding their perceptions of threats to the democratic system. Unfortunately, it also falls into the same trap as President Biden and many Democrats by broad-stroking Republicans as a party that wants to restrict democracy and “overturn voter preferences” while Democrats champion “majoritarian politics.”Left unsaid is that the United States is not a majoritarian democracy, but a constitutional republic, with built-in safeguards for less populous regions and minority interests.So when the Democratic Party supports eliminating the Electoral College, vitiating the Senate filibuster, nationalizing election laws and watering down the power of the Supreme Court, many Americans — including many staunch Trump opponents — equally see that as a threat to our longstanding system of government. Worse, they see it as an end-around simply meant to elect more Democrats.Ever since the founding of the Republic, political parties have fought over which parts of government should hold more sway: the ones focused on popular democracy, or those based on republican checks. Even in the current state of Trump-induced crisis, these competing passions contribute to a balance that makes American democracy unique and enduring.Stuart GottliebNew YorkThe writer, a former adviser and speechwriter in the U.S. Senate, teaches public policy at Columbia University.To the Editor:Haunting Russia’s dismal military performance in Ukraine is the legacy of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. With another war of choice having gone bad, from the grave Mikhail Gorbachev could tell Vladimir Putin a thing or two.At a Nov. 13, 1986, meeting of the Politburo, the Soviet leader told his comrades and generals:“We have been fighting in Afghanistan for six years already. If the approach is not changed, we will continue to fight for another 20 to 30 years. … What, are we going to fight endlessly, as testimony that our troops are not able to deal with the situation? We need to finish this process as soon as possible.”Bennett RambergLos AngelesThe writer was a foreign affairs officer in the State Department’s Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs in the George H.W. Bush administration.To the Editor:Re “Free the Student Press,” by Margaret Renkl (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 8):Ms. Renkl’s tale of the travails of the Northwest High School student newspaper, The Viking Saga, in Grand Island, Neb., brought back old memories, and a solution: samizdat.When I was in the ninth grade, some of my friends and I decided that our junior high school needed a newspaper about the students, by the students and for the students. So we created one.I was the copy editor, the layout artist and the guy who typed up the mimeograph stencils. We arranged with another student who had access to his father’s mimeograph machine to print the newspaper for us. We provided the paper and the mimeograph stencils. He provided the ink.We peddled the paper for five cents a copy. At the end of the school year we took the accumulated profits and threw ourselves a big party at the city’s most prestigious ice creamery.But in the internet age, self-publishing is much easier. Those Grand Island student journalists should simply take matters into their own hands and publish their own paper, electronically.Bill PorterVernon Hills, Ill.</body>

	<title>See the Destruction Left in Hurricane Fiona’s Wake</title>
	<author>The New York Times</author>
	<body>Islands in the Caribbean are reeling from the damage caused by Hurricane Fiona. In Puerto Rico, the storm knocked out power across the entire island. Photographs and videos show the extent of the damage to the islands in Fiona’s path.In Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, homes and at least one restaurant were damaged by heavy rains and 90-mile-per-hour winds that swept through on Monday.In Puerto Rico, the rain produced what the National Weather Service called “life-threatening and catastrophic flooding,” along with mudslides and landslides across the island. Above, a river washed away a bridge in Utuado.Torrents of rain and high winds knocked power out for most residents in Puerto Rico, including for those in San Juan.Farther south, in the towns of Yauco and Cayey, downed trees knocked out power and rivers raged dangerously high. In Cayey, a family had to clear out the mud after the La Plata river surged and almost completely submerged their two-story house on Monday.In Salinas, on the southern coast of Puerto Rico, members of the National Guard rescued a woman from her flooded home, and others sought shelter at a nearby school. As Fiona threatened other islands, people in Goyave, Guadeloupe, surveyed the damaged property and washed-out roadways a day after the hurricane swept through the French territory.</body>

	<body>One of Mayor Eric Adams’s closest advisers, who has helped formulate and work out some of the mayor’s thorniest policy challenges, has informed administration officials that he will resign at the end of the year.The adviser, Frank Carone, a former power broker in the Brooklyn Democratic Party who helped fuel Mr. Adams’s rise in politics, had served as his chief of staff since January.His exit is the first major departure of the Adams administration. Emma Wolfe, the last chief of staff for Mayor Bill de Blasio, stayed in that role for nearly all of his second term and worked in his administration for eight years.Mr. Carone served as a gatekeeper and a negotiator for Mr. Adams, meeting with business leaders and working on projects like vetting casino operators vying for casino licenses in New York City and examining whether to use cruise ships to house migrants.Mr. Carone said in an interview that he had always intended to stay in government for only one year and that he planned to serve as a chairman on Mr. Adams’s re-election campaign in 2025.“I wanted to recruit the team, take a deep dive into agencies and build a culture for that team of no drama and getting things done,” Mr. Carone said.Some of Mr. Carone’s past business dealings have drawn scrutiny, including his representation of landlords involved in an affordable housing deal and his involvement with a group of doctors accused of insurance fraud. Mr. Carone was also criticized for having a financial stake in a police tool that Mr. Adams promoted as Brooklyn borough president, and for failing to disclose his legal work for a homeless shelter provider.As the mayor’s chief of staff, Mr. Carone has largely avoided controversy, helping Mr. Adams behind the scenes to respond to one crisis after another: the pandemic, the killing of two police officers in January, high crime rates, an influx of asylum seekers from Latin America, a staffing crisis in city government and concerns over the city’s economic recovery.But Mr. Carone has traveled extensively this year, more often and farther afield than might be expected for a New York City official. Mr. Carone has said that his travel — including trips to Sweden for a global meeting on dyslexia, and to South Korea and Israel — was necessary to discuss policy issues and to create business opportunities for the city.Mr. Carone said that the city generally paid for his trips when they were for city-related business, though there were exceptions. The government of South Korea paid for his trip to that country; he added that he sometimes pays for his travel himself.Mr. Carone has also met with business leaders who want to run casinos in the city, including Rob Goldstein, the chief executive of Las Vegas Sands, and Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund manager and Mets owner, according to his detailed schedules, which were recently released through a Freedom of Information request by The New York Times.His schedules revealed that Mr. Carone met frequently with the city’s elites at Casa Cipriani, a private club on the water in Lower Manhattan where he is a member. He also had lunch on June 2 with Philip Banks III, the deputy mayor for public safety, and Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, at the Odeon restaurant near City Hall. Mr. Carone said that he pays for his membership at Casa Cipriani and for all of his meals at nice restaurants, adding there was “no reason to eat poorly” while doing the city’s business.Mr. Adams noted in an interview that Mr. Carone had worked on major projects like bidding on the Democratic National Convention in 2024 and repairing a dilapidated waterfront stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.“In the day-to-day madness, someone needs to be looking at those big-ticket items,” Mr. Adams said.The mayor said that he had asked Mr. Carone, a trusted friend and longtime adviser, to help him get his footing as mayor and to “get some W’s under our belt,” in reference to wins.“He’s been a stable voice and a stable hand during emergencies,” the mayor said. “He’s the first person I speak with in the morning and the last person I speak with at night.”No replacement for Mr. Carone has been announced.Before joining the administration, Mr. Carone left the law firm Abrams Fensterman, where he had served as an executive partner, and he said he put his assets in a blind trust. Asked if he might return to Abrams Fensterman, Mr. Carone said he had not decided what he would do next, but that he wanted to try “something new.”His financial disclosures reveal that Mr. Carone has had a lucrative career, including more than $500,000 in income last year and a Florida estate, according to Politico.Mr. Carone said that part of his job was managing relationships with state and federal officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office. Mr. Adams and Ms. Hochul have had a better relationship than their predecessors, though fissures have emerged over bail reform.Karen P. Keogh, the secretary to Gov. Hochul, said in a statement: “It’s been hugely helpful to have a reliable partner in City Hall, and Frank’s willingness to work together has helped Governor Hochul and Mayor Adams forge an historically productive relationship.”</body>

	<title>162,000 Signs That New York Is Struggling to Bounce Back</title>
	<author>James Barron</author>
	<body>Good morning. It’s Monday. Today we’ll look at why the pandemic job losses in New York City have lasted longer than anywhere in the United States.It’s a staggering number, even for New York City — 162,000, more than the population of Boulder, Colo., or Lancaster, Pa. It’s the number of jobs that the city is missing as it continues the struggle to move beyond the pandemic and into an early chapter of a very different future.Since the early months of the pandemic, New York has had the slowest jobs recovery of any major metropolitan area. If there’s a bright spot, it is this: The number of jobs that the city lost in August was about 14,000 fewer than the number from just a month before, and hiring in many industries has accelerated over the past year.I asked my colleague Nicole Hong, who with Matthew Haag has been covering the lingering economic effects of the pandemic, to explain.The rest of the country has recovered all of the jobs it lost during the pandemic. Why have jobs been slower to rebound in New York than anywhere else?As the epicenter of the virus early in the pandemic, New York City lost almost one million jobs in the first two months, the most of any city, so it had much further to go to recover. New York is also disproportionately reliant on heavy foot traffic and spending by office commuters and tourists, both of whom vanished virtually overnight in March 2020 when the pandemic hit.The severity of the public health crisis here meant that New York had longer lockdowns and more stringent vaccine mandates than many other cities, which came with their own economic costs.But many employers now say they can’t find workers, especially for jobs that can’t be done remotely. Why not?First of all, the work force in New York City is much smaller than it was in February 2020, so that’s contributing to the labor shortage. The pandemic prompted a lot of workers to retire early or move out of the city.When I interviewed workers here who lost their jobs early in the pandemic and were still unemployed, they shared a wide variety of reasons for being pickier in their job search now. Child care is a big one. Some single mothers are prioritizing finding a job closer to their children’s schools because the pandemic has been so disruptive to in-person schooling and has required more frequent pickups.Others are quitting jobs where they decided the commutes were too long. And we also spoke to people who refused to be vaccinated and were unable to work certain in-person jobs that had employer vaccine mandates.You write that things don’t look good for job growth in hotels and restaurants. How does that tie in with expectations for tourism, which was a big part of the city’s economy before the pandemic?If you walk around Times Square, it definitely feels like the tourists are completely back. But the mix of visitors is different. Levels of business and international travel are still lower than they were before the pandemic, which is a problem for New York’s economy because those visitors tended to stay longer and spend a lot more money than domestic visitors or regional day-trippers.So it’s not surprising that a majority of the jobs lost in the private sector were in the hospitality and retailing industries.That points to the lopsidedness of New York’s recovery. Hospitality and retailing have long been a way for younger people, immigrants and residents who don’t have college degrees to enter the work force.Those segments of the economy also tend to provide little opportunity for remote work. By contrast, employment in industries that allow people to work remotely, like the technology sector, is back at prepandemic levels. Until this month, white-collar workers in New York have been slower to go back to their desks than in other cities around the country.The number of office workers back at their desks seems to be creeping up slowly — last week the Partnership for New York City said 49 percent of Manhattan office workers were in their workplaces at least one day a week. That was up from 38 percent in April. But you spotlighted the ripple effects on people who aren’t covered in the Partnership’s surveys.All of the survey data shows that workers overwhelmingly want more flexibility in their schedules, and the persistence of hybrid work may be a permanent shift that emerges from the pandemic.However, there’s a consequence to a workweek where commuters are only coming in for part of the time. We spoke to an office cleaner who only recently got his job back because empty buildings don’t need as many cleaners. There are thousands of workers like him whose livelihoods depend on office buildings.So one key challenge for the city moving forward is making sure those workers access the same opportunities to transition to new careers or develop new skills.Mayor Eric Adams has often described returning to the office as an equity issue, arguing that many lower-income jobs depend on white-collar workers showing up at their offices. He has publicly scolded office workers who don’t. He famously disparaged them for staying “home in your pajamas all day.” Last week he said that remote work was worsening the city’s income divide. But some lawmakers say the lack of a hybrid option for city government workers, an option he could allow, has contributed to an exodus of municipal employees and slowed the delivery of basic services.WeatherA partly sunny day with highs in the mid-80s and a chance of a storm in the afternoon. Tonight will be cloudy with lows in the 70s.ALTERNATE-SIDE PARKINGIn effect until Sept. 26 (Rosh Hashana).U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLYThe city Department of Transportation has declared every day this week a “gridlock alert day.” Expect street closings, detours, unannounced traffic freezes and frustration as the United Nations General Assembly convenes with in-person attendance after two years of pandemic restrictions.Coney Island drowning: After three children were found dead on the shore of Coney Island, their mother was charged with murder while being evaluated in a psychiatric facility in Brooklyn.Bronx stabbing: The stabbing of a 35-year-old man who was sitting his car in July — an attack that police officials say was unprovoked — continues to rattle the Bronx neighborhood of Norwood.A pause for all: Yeshiva University, ordered by the Supreme Court to recognize an L.G.B.T.Q. student group, instead placed all undergraduate club activities on hold.No longer an app for that: The supermarket chain Wegmans has discontinued its self-checkout app, which let customers scan their groceries as they shopped. The company cited losses but did not say whether they were from customers who simply forgot to scan some items.Broadway after “Phantom”: With “Phantom of the Opera” closing in February after 35 years and 13,925 performances, which shows will become the longest-running?Point of no return: The producer Cameron Mackintosh said that a weakening box office and rising production costs led to the decision to close “Phantom of the Opera.”You’ve got disco mail: Mail sorter by day and dance-music producer at night, Richie Weeks has had 30 years of a double life spinning tracks.MoMA curator departs: After two years as the chief curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, Clément Chéroux is leaving.METROPOLITAN diaryDear Diary:It was January 2010, and my husband had made a reservation at a small French restaurant on the Upper East Side to celebrate my birthday.The tables are very close together, and we started chatting with a man and a woman who were sitting next to us.I love to share good news, so I told them it was my birthday and that after dinner we were headed to see Laura Linney in “Time Stands Still.”The man asked whether we had seen “South Pacific” at Lincoln Center.I said that, sadly, we had not. We were not Lincoln Center members although we wanted to be. There was a wait.The woman he was with spoke up.“Tonight is your lucky night,” she said. “You don’t know who you’re sitting next to.”The man gave me his business card and asked me to write my email address on it with some dates when we were available to see “South Pacific.”I was confused but did as he requested. He told me to keep an eye on my inbox. He did not offer any more information, and I did not ask any questions.After they left, I asked the waiter if he knew who the man was.Of course, he said, that was André Bishop, Lincoln Center Theater’s artistic director.We saw “South Pacific” on Valentine’s Day in house seats.— Ilene WhitmanIllustrated by Agnes Lee.

	<title>The New York City Ban on Foie Gras Is Delayed</title>
	<author>Florence Fabricant</author>
	<body>The ban of foie gras in New York City will not go into effect on Nov. 25, as a lawsuit brought by two Hudson Valley farms winds its way through the legal system. On Sept. 15, a New York State Supreme Court judge issued an injunction regarding the ban of the fattened livers of ducks and geese, first passed by the New York City Council in 2019. The court ruled that the two Hudson Valley duck farms, La Belle Farm and Hudson Valley Foie Gras, which sued in May over the ban, can continue to sell the livers to restaurants in New York City and issued a preliminary injunction on enforcing the law by the city while the matter makes its way through the court system. The passage of the prohibition was a triumph for animal rights activists, but the farms’ owners cited economic hardship, including the loss of business and 400 jobs, if the ban were to go into effect. They also claimed that the City Council exceeded its authority because the law had to do with farming practices outside the city.Steelport Knife Co., a company in Portland, Ore., which specializes in American-forged carbon-steel cutlery, now sells a bread knife with heft. It is heavy but well-balanced, 10 inches long, with a handsome polished burled wood handle. Task it to cut through delicate loaves as easily as crusty ones, slicing but not crushing. The blade’s serrations are less pointed than many, and contribute to the knife’s ease of use.Bread knife, $450, steelportknife.com. Bigger and better describes the third edition of David Joachim’s “The Food Substitutions Bible,” an alphabetical compendium first published in 2005 and now with some 8,000 listings, from A.1. Sauce to Zwieback. Descriptions of ingredients, substitutions, measurements both metric and Imperial, cross-references and even pronunciations enrich the entries. Some substitutions can be store-bought; for others, like ajvar, a Balkan sauce, there are recipes. Charts give types of rice, lentils and dal, pan sizes, eggs and more. The entries for salmon and for caviar could be more complete, but that’s a small quibble. The book is extremely easy to use, and provides proof that the printed page can be more efficient than the internet.“The Food Substitutions Bible: 8,000 Substitutions for Ingredients, Equipment &amp; Techniques” by David Joachim (Robert Rose, $49.95). Judith Norell, an owner of Silver Moon Bakery on the Upper West Side, has offered baking classes from time to time. This fall and winter she will teach four virtual sessions, an hour each, on Saturday mornings covering challah (and variations); khachapuri, the Georgian cheese bread; schüttelbrot, a flatbread from South Tyrol in Italy; and ricotta cheesecake, including homemade ricotta.

	<title>Your Monday Briefing</title>

	<body>The pressure on Russian forces in southern Ukraine deepened over the weekend. Ukrainian forces conducted strikes on Russian military strongholds, targeted sites used by local officials loyal to the Kremlin and continued to hit the supply lines for thousands of Russian soldiers on the western bank of the Dnipro River.Ukraine has been pushing a counteroffensive in the south for weeks, trying to wear down Russian fighters and force their surrender or retreat. But unlike in the northeast, where the Russian lines were quickly overwhelmed by Ukraine’s lightning assault, Russian forces in the south have spent weeks fortifying their positions against an expected Ukrainian advance.Despite the increasing pressure, there was no indication of any mass Russian withdrawal, and Russian forces have continued to assault Ukrainian positions and pound Ukrainian towns and villages. The city of Kherson and the surrounding region are the only land held by Russia west of the Dnipro.In other news from the war:A mass grave with more than 400 bodies was found in Izium, Ukrainian officials said. Read our reporter’s notebook on the devastating nature of anonymous death.Russia has begun using Iranian-made attack drones, a new weapon to counteract heavy artillery provided by the U.S.Alla Pugacheva, a pop music icon once called “the most popular human being in Russia,” declared her opposition to the invasion of Ukraine.A video showed Russian mercenaries offering to release convicts from prison in return for a six-month combat tour in Ukraine.The ten days of commemorations and mourning that have followed the death of Queen Elizabeth II will culminate today with the queen’s funeral at 11 a.m. (London time) at Westminster Abbey. The event will draw dignitaries from across the globe and a massive worldwide audience watching online and on television. Here’s the schedule.The invitees do not just include royalty, heads of state and prime ministers. Buckingham Palace has announced that the congregation will include almost 200 people who have been honored for various forms of public service. Many of those on the guest list scrambled to help during the pandemic; others have given to support their communities over the years.Ahead of her funeral, President Biden paid homage to the queen. “She was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service,” he said. The president had previously compared Elizabeth to his mother “in terms of the look of her and just the generosity,” he said last year.Welsh dispatch: A disaster in the village of Aberfan almost 60 years ago forged an unusual link between the community and the queen. The atmosphere ahead of the funeral — quiet grief coupled with brief flashes of dissent — encapsulates the national mood.“The Queue”: Tens of thousands of people have waited up to 24 hours to see the queen lying in state. Their individual acts of mourning commingled into a vast national expression of bereavement.Amid confusion, eagerness and vaccine fatigue, the U.S. last week began a new campaign to get Omicron-specific boosters into the arms of a pandemic-weary country. It has scrapped most requirements to mask, quarantine or distance, making the vaccines among the last remaining weapons in the arsenal against the coronavirus.Millions of doses of boosters targeting the hyper-contagious variant have arrived with little ceremony, ready to be administered in what health officials now expect to become a yearly inoculation ritual akin to a flu shot. Early numbers from states and several cities showed what health officials described as a robust early response.Unlike in earlier waves of vaccinations, the campaign was so understated that some Americans willing to get boosted did not even realize a new shot was available. But for others, worried that their immunity has waned, the new shots, which are tailored to protect against both Omicron and the original version of the virus, could not come soon enough.Statistics: About 68 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated with the original shots, but only one-third have gotten any booster shot, even though they first became available in September 2021.Hurricane Fiona has knocked out power to all of Puerto Rico.Millions of people have been ordered to evacuate after Typhoon Nanmadol brought torrential rain to Japan’s southernmost main island.A powerful earthquake killed at least one person in Taiwan yesterday.Nearly 100 people have died in a border conflict between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, according to reports from Reuters.Six Republican contenders in key midterm states, all backed by Donald Trump, said they would not commit to accepting the November outcome.On a trip to Armenia, Nancy Pelosi, the U.S. House speaker, condemned Azerbaijan over recent clashes while also calling for a negotiated settlement.At a rally for Trump, music played that was all but identical to a theme song for the conspiracy theory movement QAnon.Italy celebrated the return of three stolen ancient terra-cotta figures, depicting “Orpheus and the Sirens,” in a ceremony on Saturday in Rome.In the city that never sleeps, some doors now close at 10 p.m.On a recent night out, startled customers all over New York City grappled with scaled-back hours at formerly up-all-night institutions. But the evidence suggests that late night nibbles of the Big Apple, even while they may have morphed and moved, have not entirely disappeared.Kalvin Phillips has rare ability, but his shoulder injury is a problem: The Manchester City midfielder has a rare set of skills, with the ability to play long attacking passes while offering a strong defensive repertoire.

In so doing, he also completely transformed the sport of tennis.“The Phantom of the Opera” is the longest-running show in Broadway history. Based on Gaston Leroux’s 1910 novel, which inspired a Lon Chaney movie, this symbol of musical theater will drop its famous chandelier for the last time in February after 35 years. The show becomes the latest to fall victim to the drop in audiences since the pandemic hit.The show, about a mask-wearing opera lover who haunts the Paris Opera House and becomes obsessed with a young soprano, is characterized by over-the-top spectacle and melodrama. A 1988 review acknowledged: “It may be possible to have a terrible time at ‘The Phantom of the Opera,’ but you’ll have to work at it.”Speaking about the decision to end the show’s run, the producer, Cameron Mackintosh, said: “I’m both sad and celebrating. It’s an extraordinary achievement, one of the greatest successes of all time.

	<title>Biden Calls Trump ‘Irresponsible’ Over Mar-a-Lago Documents</title>
	<author>Jim Tankersley</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — President Biden said in an interview aired on Sunday evening that former President Donald J. Trump had been “totally irresponsible” for keeping top-secret documents at his residence and private club in Florida, but he said he had not asked for specifics about the documents in order to stay out of the Justice Department’s potential decision to charge Mr. Trump criminally.Speaking to Scott Pelley of CBS’s “60 Minutes,” in interviews taped from Washington and from Mr. Biden’s trip last week to the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, the president also declared the Covid-19 pandemic “over” and said the country seemed to be in good shape.“The pandemic is over,” Mr. Biden said, speaking on the floor of the auto show, which he visited to champion his administration’s efforts to bolster electric vehicle production in the United States.“We still have a problem with Covid,” he said, according to a transcript provided by “60 Minutes.” “We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over. If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it’s changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.”Mr. Biden’s pronouncement was rosier than the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said last week that “we have never been in a better position to end the pandemic” but that the world is “not there yet.”In the interview, Mr. Biden expressed optimism over inflation, which hit a 40-year high this summer. The president stressed falling gasoline prices and focused on the monthly rate of price increases, which slowed in July and August, even though annual inflation continues to top 8 percent.Asked if he was telling Americans that “inflation is going to continue to decline,” Mr. Biden said no, then highlighted measures on health care and energy that he signed into law last month.“I’m telling the American people that we’re going to get control of inflation,” he said. “And their prescription drug prices are going to be a hell of a lot lower. Their health care costs are going to be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody, their energy prices are going to be lower. They’re going to be in a situation where they begin to gain control again. I’m more optimistic than I’ve been in a long time.”Mr. Biden similarly expressed confidence that the country could avoid a recession even as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates aggressively to slow consumer demand and bring down inflation. But he acknowledged that the economy dodged potential catastrophe last week when negotiations hosted by Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh yielded a tentative agreement between freight rail companies and labor unions to avert a nationwide rail strike. Union members must still ratify the deal.“If, in fact, they’d gone on a strike, the supply chains in this country would’ve come to a screeching halt,” Mr. Biden said. “We would’ve seen a real economic crisis.”Mr. Biden told Mr. Pelley that he had not been briefed on the documents that F.B.I. agents seized last month during their search of Mr. Trump’s home, Mar-a-Lago, and that he had not spoken to anyone about what national security secrets might have been revealed by the documents’ storage in Mr. Trump’s home. He also reiterated that he had not been notified of the search ahead of time.Mr. Pelley asked Mr. Biden what he thought when he saw a photograph, released by the F.B.I., of the seized documents laid out by agents on the floor of Mar-a-Lago.“How that could possibly happen?” Mr. Biden replied. “How one — anyone could be that irresponsible. And I thought, ‘What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods?’”“Totally irresponsible,” he added.Mr. Biden said he had not asked for specifics of the documents’ contents “because I don’t want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take. I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not.”On foreign policy, Mr. Biden said Ukraine was “defeating Russia” by making gains in repelling its invading army, but he stopped short of saying Ukrainians were “winning the war.”“Russia’s turning out not to be as competent and capable as many people thought they were going to be,” he said. “But winning the war? The damage it’s doing, and the citizens, and the innocent people are being killed, it’s awful hard to count that as winning.”The president also said that American forces would defend Taiwan if it were attacked by China but insisted there was no change to U.S. policy on the island. It was not the first time this year that he made that vow, a seeming break from a long tradition of the United States refraining from taking a posture. And after the president’s interview, White House officials told CBS that the government continues not to take a public position on the issue of committing troops.Mr. Biden told Mr. Pelley that he had not made a “firm decision” on whether to seek a second term in the White House, though he said it remained his intention. Asked whether, as the nation’s oldest president, he was fit for the job, Mr. Biden replied, “Watch me.”“If you think I don’t have the energy level or the mental acuity, then — then, you know, that’s one thing,” Mr. Biden said. He added: “I respect the fact that people would say, you know, ‘You’re old.’ But I think it relates to how much energy you have and whether or not the job you’re doing is one consistent with what any person of any age would be able to do.”“How would you say your mental focus is?” Mr. Pelley asked.“Oh, it’s focused,” Mr. Biden said, adding, “I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, my own head, the number of years.”“There’s not things I don’t do now that I did before,” he added, “whether it’s physical or mental or anything else.”</body>

	<title>Windsor, Queen’s Final Resting Place, Has a Long Association With Her</title>
	<author>Stephen Castle</author>
	<body>WINDSOR, England— Queen Elizabeth’s final journey began more than a week ago in Scotland when her coffin left Balmoral, the country estate she adored, where she sought tranquillity, and where she died.On Monday, that odyssey ended at a place that by all accounts she loved just as much: Windsor Castle, the home she favored throughout her long reign and the place where she was buried alongside her husband, father and other family members.In Windsor, as in London, thousands gathered in the sunshine to pay their respects, lining the imposing approach to the castle, known as the Long Walk, to see the funeral procession.Like the events in London, this, too, was a ceremony executed with military precision and with the pomp and pageantry at which Britain excels.But after the state funeral at Westminster Abbey, attended by world leaders, Windsor was where the royal family bade farewell to the queen — a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother — when her coffin was lowered into the royal vault. A lone piper played a lament, the sound of which faded into the distance as he retreated.For people who live in or around Windsor, which sees itself as the home of the monarchy, the event was poignant because of the long connection with the queen.Windsor was the place that the young Elizabeth spent much of her time during World War II. When she became queen she routinely spent weekends at the castle, enjoying its expansive grounds where she could walk with her dogs or ride horses.When fire ripped through parts of Windsor Castle in 1992 it was one of several malign events that year that contributed to what the queen called her “annus horribilis.”More recently the castle — which has been a royal home and fortress for 900 years — became a refuge for the queen during the pandemic. She was seen only last year on horseback on the castle grounds.“It seems right to come and pay our respects and watch her journey home,” said Ben Pearson, from nearby Maidenhead, as he awaited the coffin several hours ahead of its arrival in Windsor.Windsor is also special for the British royal family, so special that it took the name of the town as its own in 1917, during World War I, when Britain was at war with Germany. Sensing the unpopularity of all things German, the royal family became the House of Windsor by a proclamation of King George V, replacing the historic name of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.Just a few hundred yards from the queen’s private apartments in Windsor lies St. George’s Chapel, which was begun in 1475 by Edward IV and completed by Henry VIII in 1528, and which is now her last resting place.Throughout Queen Elizabeth’s long life this was a place of worship and the scene of important ceremonies including Garter Day as well as royal weddings, such as that of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018.St. George’s Chapel is also the preferred burial place for the royal family, and it was there just last year that the queen mourned the death of her husband of more than 70 years, Prince Philip. The queen was seen seated alone at a sparsely attended service and masked to comply with coronavirus rules.Monday’s events at Windsor had strong echoes of that funeral as King Charles, the new monarch, and other members of the royal family walked behind the queen’s coffin, just as they had done last year behind that of Prince Philip. (In his case, at his request, the hearse was a Land Rover S.U.V. that he had helped modify.)At some earlier points in Britain’s history, Westminster Abbey, where the queen’s state funeral took place on Monday morning, was the more popular resting place of British royalty. Among those who lie there is Elizabeth I. But King George II, who died in 1760, was the last monarch to be buried in Westminster Abbey.After the funeral of Prince Philip last year, his coffin was lowered into the royal vault at St. George’s to await a post-mortem reunion with the queen. That was taking place at a private service on Monday evening, where the queen’s remains were to be buried alongside those of Prince Philip in the King George VI Memorial Chapel. That, small, chapel also accommodates the remains of the queen’s father, mother and her sister, Princess Margaret.Given her long association with Windsor, Monday’s procession to the castle and the committal service felt to many like a homecoming for Queen Elizabeth.Karl Dixon, who traveled on Friday from Glossop, around 200 miles away, and had slept in a motor home since, said he was drawn to Windsor, rather than going to London to view the queen’s coffin lying at rest as thousands of others had done.“It was also her home, and her late husband is buried here as well as a lot of her ancestors,” said Mr. Dixon, a landscape gardener. “I just felt this is the final resting place,” he added.</body>

	<title>Her Majesty’s Last Broadcast</title>
	<author>James Poniewozik</author>
	<body>Television introduced Queen Elizabeth II to the world. It was only fitting that television should see her out of it.The queen’s seven-decade reign almost exactly spanned the modern TV era. Her coronation in 1953 began the age of global video spectacles. Her funeral on Monday was a full-color pageant accessible to billions.It was a final display of the force of two institutions: the concentrated grandeur of the British monarchy and the power amassed by television to bring viewers to every corner of the world.“I have to be seen to be believed,” Elizabeth once reportedly said. It was less a boast than an acknowledgment of a modern duty. One had to be seen, whether one liked it or not. It was her source of authority at a time when the crown’s power no longer came through fleets of ships. It was how she provided her country reassurance and projected stability.The last funeral service for a British monarch, King George VI, was not televised. For one last time, Elizabeth was the first. She entered the world stage, through the new magic of broadcasting, as a resolute young face. She departed it as a bejeweled crown on a purple cushion, transmuted finally into pure visual symbol.Americans who woke up early Monday (or stayed up, in some time zones) saw striking images aplenty, on every news network. The breathtaking God’s-eye view from above the coffin in Westminster Abbey. The continuous stream of world leaders. The thick crowds along the procession to Windsor, flinging flowers at the motorcade. The corgis.Viewers also saw and heard something unusual in the TV news environment: long stretches of unnarrated live action — the speaking of prayers, the clop of horse hooves — and moments of stillness. This was notable in the golf-whisper coverage on BBC World News, which let scenes like the loading of the coffin onto a gun carriage play out in silence, its screen bare of the usual lower-thirds captions.The commercial American networks, being the distant relations at this service, filled in the gaps with chattery bits of history and analysis. News departments called in the Brits. (On Fox News, the reality-TV fixtures Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne critiqued Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s media ventures.) “Royal commentators” broke down points of protocol and inventoried the materials and symbolism of the crown, scepter and orb like auction appraisers.But even American TV fell still during the funeral ceremony. The cameras drank in the Gothic arches of Westminster Abbey, bathed in the hymns of the choirs, goggled at the royal jewels, lingered on the solemn face of Charles III during the performance of — it still sounds strange — “God Save the King.” Finally, we watched from above as bearers carried the coffin step by step across the black-and-white-diamond floor like an ornate chess piece.The quiet spectating was a gesture of respect but also a kind of tourist’s awe. We had come all this way; of course we wanted to take in the sights.Becoming queen. Following the death of King George VI, Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary ascended to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, at age 25. The coronation of the newly minted Queen Elizabeth II took place on June 2 the following year.A historic visit. On May 18, 1965, Elizabeth arrived in Bonn on the first state visit by a British monarch to Germany in more than 50 years. The trip formally sealed the reconciliation between the two nations following the world wars.First grandchild. In 1977, the queen stepped into the role of grandmother for the first time, after Princess Anne gave birth to a son, Peter. Elizabeth’s four children have given her a total of eight grandchildren, who have been followed by several great-grandchildren.Princess Diana’s death. In a rare televised broadcast ahead of Diana’s funeral in 1997, Queen Elizabeth remembered the Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris at age 36, as “an exceptional and gifted human being.”Golden jubilee. In 2002, celebrations to mark Elizabeth II's 50 years as queen culminated in a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace in the presence of 12,000 cheering guests, with an estimated one million more watching on giant screens set up around London.A trip to Ireland. In May 2011, the queen visited the Irish Republic, whose troubled relationship with the British monarchy spanned centuries. The trip, infused with powerful symbols of reconciliation, is considered one of the most politically freighted trips of Elizabeth’s reign.Breaking a record. As of 5:30 p.m. British time on Sept. 9, 2015, Elizabeth II became Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Elizabeth was 89 at the time, and had ruled for 23,226 days, 16 hours and about 30 minutes.Marking 70 years of marriage. On Nov. 20, 2017, the queen and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th anniversary, becoming the longest-married couple in royal history. The two wed in 1947, as the country and the world was still reeling from the atrocities of World War II.Losing her spouse. In 2021, Queen Elizabeth II bade farewell to Prince Philip, who died on April 9. An image of the queen grieving alone at the funeral amid coronavirus restrictions struck a chord with viewers at home following the event.Elizabeth’s reign was marked by unprecedented visibility, for better or worse. Her coronation in 1953 spurred the British to buy television sets, bringing the country into the TV age and inviting the public into an event once reserved for the upper crust.This changed something essential in the relation of the masses to the monarchy. The coronation, with its vestments and blessings, signified the exclusive connection of the monarch to God. Once that was no longer exclusive, everything else in the relationship between the ruler and the public was up for negotiation.The young queen resisted letting in the cameras. The prime minister Winston Churchill worried about making the ritual into a “theatrical performance.” But Elizabeth could no more stop the force of media than her forebear King Canute could halt the tide.TV undercut the mystique of royalty but spread its image, expanding the queen’s virtual reach even as the colonial empire diminished. There were other surviving monarchies in the world, but the Windsors were the default royals of TV-dom, the main characters in a generational reality-TV soap opera. They became global celebrities, through scandals, weddings, deaths and “The Crown.”The coronation had worldwide effects too. It began the age when TV would bring the world into your living room live — or at least close to it. In 1953, with live trans-Atlantic broadcasts still not yet possible, CBS and NBC raced to fly the kinescopes of the event across the ocean in airplanes with their seats removed to fit in editing equipment. (They both lost to Canada’s CBC, which got its footage home first.)The next day’s Times heralded the event as the “birth of international television,” marveling that American viewers “probably saw more than the peers and peeresses in their seats in the transept.” Boy, did they: NBC’s “Today” show coverage, which carried a radio feed of the coronation, included an appearance by its chimpanzee mascot, J. Fred Muggs. Welcome to show business, Your Majesty.The one limit on cameras at Elizabeth’s coronation was to deny them a view of the ritual anointment of the new queen. By 2022, viewers take divine omniscience for granted. If we can think of it, we should be able to see it.So after Elizabeth’s death, you could monitor the convoy from Balmoral Castle in Scotland to London, with a glassy hearse designed and lit to make the coffin visible. You could watch the queen’s lying-in-state in Westminster Hall on live video feeds, from numerous angles, the silence broken only by the occasional cry of a baby or cough of a guard. The faces came and went, including the queen’s grandchildren joining the tribute, but the camera’s vigil was constant.After 70 years, however, television has lost its exclusive empire as well. Even as it broadcast what was described — plausibly but vaguely — as the most-watched event in history, traditional TV shared the funeral audience with the internet and social media.Elizabeth and the medium that defined her reign were both unifiers of a kind that we might not see again. Though not all of the British support the monarchy, the queen offered her fractious country a sense of constancy. TV brought together disparate populations in the communal experience of seeing the same thing at once.Now what? Tina Brown, the writer, editor and royal-watcher, asked on CBS, “Will anyone be loved by the nation so much again?” You could also ask: Will Charles’s coronation next year be nearly as big a global media event? Will anything? (You could also ask whether an event like this should be so all-consuming. While American TV news was wall-to-wall with an overseas funeral, Puerto Rico was flooded and without power from Hurricane Fiona.)Monday’s services felt like a capstone to two eras. For one day, we saw a display of the pageantry that the crown can command and the global audience that TV can.American TV spent its full morning with the queen. (Well, almost: CBS aired the season premiere of “The Price Is Right.”) The day’s pomp built toward one more never-before-broadcast ceremony, the removal of scepter, orb and crown from the coffin, which was lowered into the vault at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor. Then followed something almost unimaginable: A private burial service, with no TV cameras.Television got one final spectacle out of Elizabeth’s reign. And the queen had one final moment out of the public eye.</body>

	<title>What’s on TV This Week: ‘The Bachelorette’ and ‘Abbott Elementary’</title>
	<author>Shivani Gonzalez</author>
	<body>Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Sept. 19-25. Details and times are subject to change.THE NEIGHBORHOOD 8 p.m. on CBS. This sitcom, starring Cedric the Entertainer and Max Greenfield, is back for its fifth season. The show’s premise is: What happens when Dave (Greenfield), an earnest professional conflict negotiator, moves in next to Calvin (Cedric), an auto-repair shop owner in a mostly Black neighborhood in California? The result is a sometimes heartwarming, sometimes contentious relationship.THE VOICE 8 p.m. on NBC. Camila Cabello, John Legend, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani will be back in their plush red swivel chairs this week as the 22nd season of this competition singing show begins. As always, the first episode is a blind audition in which singers perform with the judges faced away — if a judge likes what they hear, they turn around.THE RESIDENT 8 p.m. on Fox. Last season of this medical drama ended on a bittersweet note with Dr. Conrad Hawkins (Matt Czuchry) looking back on memories of his wife (Emily VanCamp), a nurse who died in a car crash. The beginning of the new season involves Conrad making a decision about his current love life.THE BACHELORETTE 8 p.m. on ABC. With this season’s finale, we can hope for not one but two engagements. That’s because the show has featured two leads this year — Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey (who both had their heart broken by Clayton Echard last season) — and each has one suitor left. Time will tell if two weddings are in the cards, or if more people fall into the crowded group of failed “Bachelor” relationships.THE MASKED SINGER 8 p.m. on Fox. This show, which originated in South Korea and involves celebrities performing in elaborate costumes until someone guesses their identity, begins its eight season. Past contestants have included Natasha Bedingfield, Wiz Khalifa and Logan Paul, just to name a few. We already have a sneak peek of two of the “characters”: a fortune teller and a pi-rat (that’s half pirate, half rat).ABBOTT ELEMENTARY 9 p.m. on ABC. Just over a week after winning two Emmy Awards (Sheryl Lee Ralph for best supporting actress in a comedy, and Quinta Brunson for best writing for comedy), this show is back for Season 2, with teachers returning to school for development week. Leslie Odom Jr., Lauren Weedman and Keyla Monterroso Mejia will be guest starring this season.NORMAN LEAR: 100 YEARS OF MUSIC AND LAUGHTER 9 p.m. on ABC. George Clooney, Laverne Cox, Tom Hanks, Rita Moreno, Jennifer Aniston, Jimmy Kimmel, Amy Poehler, Kristen Bell and Octavia Spencer are a few of the names who will be giving speeches or performing comedy sets in this special celebrating the screenwriter and producer Norman Lear, known for “All in the Family,” “The Jeffersons” and “Good Times.” He turned 100 years old in late July.SHARK TANK 8 p.m. on ABC. The sharks (a.k.a. the judges) Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Lori Greiner, Robert Herjavec, Daymond John and Kevin O’Leary are back for the 14th season of this business reality show, and the Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow and the DoorDash chief executive Tony Xu are joining them. This week’s premiere will be live, so audience members can weigh in on whether the sharks should make a deal with the entrepreneurs.THE SUNSHINE BOYS (1975) 6 p.m. on TCM. This film, based on Neil Simon’s 1972 play by the same name, stars Walter Matthau, Richard Benjamin and George Burns (who won an Academy Award for his role). The movie is about two comedians who reunite years after their vaudeville comedy act was popular. “‘The Sunshine Boys,’ which I like, is the sort of movie that makes you grin almost continuously, laugh out loud on a number of occasions, and then, at the end, leaves you wondering if that’s all there is,” Vincent Canby wrote in his review of the film for The New York Times.GLOBAL CITIZEN FESTIVAL: TAKE ACTION NOW 7 p.m. on ABC. This live concert, hosted by Priyanka Chopra Jonas and taking place in Central Park in New York City and in Accra, Ghana, seeks to raise funds for extreme poverty. Metallica, Charlie Puth, the Jonas Brothers, Mariah Carey and Rosalía will perform in New York while Usher and  SZA  are set to perform in Accra.VAN DER VALK 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This show, starring Marc Warren as Piet Van der Valk, the titular homicide cop in Amsterdam, is back for a second season. It starts off with a gruesome murder of a solicitor with a confusing note in the pocket of her coat when her body is found.</body>

	<title>After Texas Sent Him to Washington, One Migrant Launches a New Life</title>
	<author>Miriam Jordan</author>
	<body>When Lever Alejos of Venezuela arrived at the southern border penniless in July, he gladly accepted a free bus ride to Washington, D.C., courtesy of the state of Texas. He had no family or friends to receive him, and spent one night in the plaza across from Union Station. He soon settled into a homeless shelter.“I have nothing,” Mr. Alejos, 29, said on his third day in the city, “but I have the will to work and succeed.”Two months later, Mr. Alejos is making between $600 to $700 a week, saving up to buy a used car and planning to move out of the shelter.“There is so much opportunity here,” he said on Thursday, at the end of a day’s work. “You just have to take advantage of it.”Since April, thousands of migrants, most of them Venezuelans, have been coaxed onto buses and planes heading to Washington, New York, Chicago and, last week, Martha’s Vineyard after enduring a perilous journey over land from their broken country to make a fresh start in the United States.The transportation to the Democratic strongholds has been organized by Texas, Florida and Arizona, whose governors are trying to draw attention to a record surge in the number of people crossing the border, which they blame on the Biden administration’s immigration policies.Last week, Mr. Abbott dropped off two busloads of migrants near the residence of Vice President Kamala Harris, and more over the weekend. Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, on Wednesday chartered two small planes to fly 50 migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, the upscale vacation island off Massachusetts, which he has derided as a liberal bastion.Democrats have called the stunts cruel, and many migrants have been left at least temporarily homeless as their new host cities scramble to help them.But others, like Mr. Alejos, have called the free transportation a blessing. They are already employed and achieving some measure of stability. They have found jobs in construction, hospitality, retail, trucking and other sectors facing worker shortages in an economy still recovering from the impact of the pandemic.“In most big cities, including the ones where governors are shipping migrants, employers are scrambling to find workers,” said Chris Tilly, a labor economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “They are meeting a need.”Michelle Rumbaut, a hospital administrator who assists migrants in San Antonio, recalled a recent group of young Venezuelans she encountered who were determined to reach New York, where jobs awaited them.They were exhausted and traumatized after witnessing young girls being raped, trudging past dead fellow migrants and being robbed on their monthslong journey to reach the United States, she recalled.But they immediately found work clearing trees for real estate developers in the San Antonio area, amassing enough money to buy one-way flights to New York.Migrants like Mr. Alejos are at once symbols of a burgeoning humanitarian crisis, pawns in a partisan debate, and people simply following the economics of supply and demand.Most face an uphill battle to win their asylum cases. But it will be years before the legal process is complete, and those who lose their cases tend to live the rest of their lives in the shadows, trying to stay employed and out of the grasp of immigration officers tasked with deporting them.In the meantime, they are both straining the resources of cities trying to provide them social services, and  filling a gap in the nation’s labor market.While as many as 8 million immigrants are working in the United States without authorization, asylum applicants eventually receive employment permits while their cases are pending.Since 2015, Venezuelans fleeing hardship have been pouring into South American countries — Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Chile. All told, nearly seven million have left the country in that time, more than one out of five Venezuelans.As the coronavirus pandemic hobbled those economies, Venezuelans began leaving South American host countries for the United States. Others began migrating directly from Venezuela, as word spread that Venezuelans were being allowed to enter the United States and then apply for asylum.They represent the fastest-growing group of migrants arriving at the Mexico-U.S. border.On their 3,000-mile trek to reach that border, they must traverse the Darien Gap, a 60-mile stretch through dense jungle, where migrants said they have fallen prey to bandits, drug traffickers and human smugglers. At a post at the route’s end, Doctors Without Borders reported that it had attended to 100 victims of rape in the first five months of 2022.This year, Mr. Alejos decided he had to brave that arduous journey.Solidly middle class in Venezuela, he was struggling to keep his machine-repair shop afloat amid the country’s economic collapse. In Venezuela these days, many people make just a few dollars a day.To pay for the odyssey across seven countries, Mr. Alejos sold his repair shop in his hometown of Barquisimeto in northern Venezuela for the miserly sum of $750. “That was my down payment on a new life,” he said.His trek through the Darien Gap was a nightmare, he said. Mexican officials and cartels were menacing.When he finally waded across the Rio Grande to Texas, he turned himself in to U.S. border authorities, who processed him, gave him immigration papers and delivered him to a shed, where other Venezuelans also had been dropped off.Then, they were offered a free bus to Washington, or a $50 bus ride to San Antonio.In late July, they arrived in Washington.Within days, Mr. Alejos found work in construction. By the second week, he was sending money home to support his 7-year-old son, Christopher, and saving to buy a cellphone. By late fall, he plans to move out of the shelter to his own place.After an allergic reaction to chemicals on his construction job, he quit and came across an ad on a Facebook page of Venezuelans in Washington. A company was looking for people to work at events — football and soccer games, conferences and private parties in a variety of capacities.Soon, he was stocking concession stands with food and other supplies the day before games, and serving spectators hot dogs, nachos and beer during the events. He has worked at FedEx Field in Maryland; college facilities, such as the University of Virginia’s Scott Stadium; and other venues in the area.Sometimes, he has been asked to work as a bartender, waiter or dishwasher.That is not dream work, he said, but it is a good start — and he is giving it his all.“I always show initiative, performing extra tasks here and there that my supervisor notices,” he said. “This could lead to something bigger; I’m gaining experience.”“What I need now is to achieve financial stability, he said. “Next will come professional growth.”He sends his son $150 twice a month.“Christopher’s quality of life has improved 100 percent since I came to this country,” he said, citing better nutrition, new clothes, outings to restaurants and visits to an amusement park.For himself, Mr. Alejos has acquired a new cellphone and ear buds, shirts and trousers, and shoes. “I try to keep my priorities straight,” he said. “I’m not splurging. I am trying to build an emergency fund.”In three weeks, he hopes to buy a 2012 Honda Civic.His only regret is that his schedule does not allow him to attend in-person English classes. But he has found a way to teach himself, the Duolingo language-learning app — and then he tries to practice with customers.Mr. Alejos said that he had followed instructions he received from authorities to check in at the local immigration office, and that he planned to apply for asylum.He will have to argue his case before an immigration judge but said that he had yet to be notified about his first court date. The process typically unfolds over several years. The chances of winning are slim, and applicants are ordered to depart from the United States if they lose. But by the time a decision is issued, many migrants have established themselves, a disincentive to leave. While thousands of migrants have been swiftly expelled to Mexico or deported back to their countries under a pandemic-related health order known as Title 42, Venezuelans are not subject to the policy because Mexico will not accept them and the United States does not have diplomatic ties with Venezuela.In his free time, Mr. Alejos explores his adopted city with fellow Venezuelans, visiting the Natural History Museum, the Zoo, Chinatown and the Capitol.“I always try to see something new on my days off,’’ he said, and often during the outings he posts selfies on Facebook.He misses his family, he said. But he is philosophical about his circumstances.“Often you have to suffer to be compensated down the road,” he said.After spending a night in the street and another in a shelter where he felt unsafe, Mr. Alejos has been staying at a different shelter that he described as tidy, comfortable and orderly. “Each person has a locker; the sheets are clean; showers have hot water and there’s Wi-Fi — all the services,” he said.“I feel fortunate the governor put me on a bus to Washington,” Mr. Alejos said. “It opened up doors for me.”</body>

	<title>In a Season of Frustration, the Brewers Are Still Fighting</title>
	<author>James Wagner</author>
	<body>MILWAUKEE — In baseball, being too good can sometimes be a curse.Take the 2021 Milwaukee Brewers. They were in first place in the National League Central for most of the regular season. Behind a dominant pitching staff, the Brewers built such a large lead in a weaker division — 14 games by mid-September — that when they struggled in the closing weeks, they still backed into the division title with 95 wins. The games down the stretch didn’t have the same importance and, despite their best efforts, the Brewers limped into the playoffs, where they were quickly bounced by the eventual champion Atlanta Braves.“We played marvelously until the final two weeks of the year,” Brewers shortstop Willy Adames said in Spanish over the weekend. “Then we went in the wrong direction and we couldn’t get out of there, and that was the reason we didn’t advance past the first round.”This year, the small-market Brewers don’t have a cushion. They need every win and as much time as possible to ensure their streak of four straight postseason appearances isn’t snapped.Despite a 2022 season defined by injuries and inconsistency, the Brewers (78-68 through Sunday) are still within striking distance of the third N.L. wild card. After taking two of three games from the Yankees over the weekend, they were two games behind the Philadelphia Phillies (80-66). And perhaps, Adames said, playing games in the closing weeks that matter more will have a positive effect on the Brewers this time around.“That’s the energy the guys have, and they know we need to win and we have to do whatever possible to enter the postseason,” he said. “If we reach the playoffs that way, it’s better.”As many past Octobers have shown, the team with the best regular-season record doesn’t always win the World Series. A long summer of success can end abruptly in a three-game series. And sometimes the team playing the best going into the playoffs is the most dangerous. So even though the Brewers were a better team last year, they hope that they can find enough consistency to nab a playoff spot and ride that deep into October.“It’s just fun this time of year,” Brewers starter Brandon Woodruff said over the weekend. “I love playoff baseball, and hopefully we can keep stringing together some wins and get in, and you never know what’s going to happen.”The Brewers weren’t expected to be in this position. Because of a returning cast of characters — led by a rotation headlined by the 2021 Cy Young Award winner Corbin Burnes, Freddy Peralta and Woodruff — they were expected to contend again for a division title.The Brewers were leading the Central as recently as Aug. 3, but the St. Louis Cardinals caught them from behind and built what was an eight-game lead through Sunday, thanks to a 37-17 record since the All-Star break in July. The Brewers went 28-25 in the same span — good enough to stay in wild-card contention but not nearly enough to keep pace with St. Louis.“The Cardinals are an unbelievable team,” said Woodruff. He added, about his own team: “You might have a lot of the same guys in the room, but you have other people here, too. Every year is just different. It’s been a little bit more of a grind, but we get to this time of the year and we’re still right there.”Among the biggest culprits for the Brewers’ struggles, Woodruff said, have been the health and consistency of the rotation. Four key starters have missed time with injuries. Woodruff has a 2.55 earned run average since his return from the injured list in late June, but ankle and finger ailments cost him a month. Aaron Ashby and Peralta are each on their second I.L. stints of the season for arm injuries. Adrian Houser missed 44 games this summer with an elbow injury. And Eric Lauer is working his way back from an elbow injury. (Burnes has been typically excellent, with a 2.97 E.R.A. over 179 innings through Sunday.)The result: A rotation considered the second most valuable in M.L.B. in 2021, according to Fangraphs, was ranked 14th through Sunday.(There have also been a whole host of other players who have missed time such as Adames, who was on the I.L. for three weeks early in the season with an ankle sprain, and outfielder Hunter Renfroe, who had two I.L. stints for leg ailments.)At the Aug. 2 trade deadline, the Brewers front office traded away closer Josh Hader, a three-time N.L. reliever of the year — a move that bothered some in the clubhouse. The reasoning was simple: The Brewers had an in-house replacement (the All-Star Devin Williams, who has a 1.76 E.R.A.), and Hader, who is eligible for free agency this off-season, had been struggling. He has pitched worse in San Diego (13 runs in 13 appearances) and lost the closer’s job. The Brewers’ bullpen reinforcements brought in via trade have either been so-so (Taylor Rogers) or gotten injured (Trevor Rosenthal and Matt Bush).“We just haven’t been able to combine all parts of our play, like hitting with pitching,” Adames said. “But in the past two weeks, I think we’ve played better baseball and we’re moving in a better direction.”Thankfully for the Brewers, Adames has helped steady the team’s offense. They were scoring at roughly the same clip as last season (4.5 runs per game through Sunday), but the biggest change has been in their power.The Brewers ranked 23rd in slugging percentage last season but had jumped to eighth place ahead of their three-game series against the Mets that was set to begin on Monday. The Brewers’ 202 home runs trailed only the Yankees (231) and Braves (220).First baseman Rowdy Tellez had 31 home runs through Sunday, Renfroe had 25, and Adames broke the Hall of Famer Robin Yount’s single-season franchise record for home runs by a shortstop on Saturday with his 30th. The only other shortstop in M.L.B. with 30 home runs or more this season is Corey Seager of the Texas Rangers.“It’s special to me and it means the world to me to be right next to a legend like Robin Yount,” Adames said, adding later, “I’m trying to do the most to help the team win games. We need it now the most.”Adames said he was grateful that the postseason format had expanded this year to 12 teams from 10 because it gives the Brewers a chance. And while most players insist they don’t check the scoreboards to see how opponents are doing, Woodruff admitted he did at night after the Brewers’ games were over. Time is running out to catch the Phillies or Padres.“Obviously we’re not blind to what’s going on,” Woodruff said, “but we try to focus on each other and trying to win a baseball game each day.”</body>

	<title>In Parks and on Post Boxes, Crowds Say Farewell to the Queen</title>
	<author>Megan Specia</author>
	<body>LONDON — They came in droves to central London, arriving before dawn and flocking to blockaded streets. Some had camped overnight. Others made hourslong journeys in the darkness to score a prime location for the royal spectacle. They stood on stepladders, or scaled mailboxes, or huddled before giant screens in Hyde Park to get the best view they could of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. “I needed to say my final goodbye,” said Beny Hamedi, 55, who clutched a photo of the queen. “And I think it will be a moment no one will ever forget.”The 11 days since Queen Elizabeth II died at the age of 96 have been a coordinated exercise in public grief as Britain comes to terms with the loss of its longest-serving monarch.The vigils that have popped up on the streets and in parks, the serpentine queue to see her coffin lying in state, the cross-country travel for royal commemorations — they have all been a way to bid farewell to a woman many viewed as family, people said time and again.But in some ways, the days of ceremonies have also been a moment for Britons to reinforce their national sense of identity. And they have provided a much-needed distraction from a frightening cost-of-living crisis and a period of political turmoil that have dominated the national agenda for months.Perhaps nowhere were those sentiments felt more fully than in the crowds that gathered in and around central London to see the procession that followed the queen’s state funeral in nearby Westminster Abbey.“We are never going to see a queen again in our lifetime,” said Melissa Hackett, 28, who had traveled with a friend from her home in Doncaster in northern England on Sunday, referring to the line of succession. The queen’s eldest son is now King Charles III. His son William is second in line, followed by his own eldest son, George.Outside the long stretches of barricades that blocked off much of the area around the parade route from the still arriving crowd, hawkers sold homemade programs and small Union Jack flags. Becoming queen. Following the death of King George VI, Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary ascended to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, at age 25. The coronation of the newly minted Queen Elizabeth II took place on June 2 the following year.A historic visit. On May 18, 1965, Elizabeth arrived in Bonn on the first state visit by a British monarch to Germany in more than 50 years. The trip formally sealed the reconciliation between the two nations following the world wars.First grandchild. In 1977, the queen stepped into the role of grandmother for the first time, after Princess Anne gave birth to a son, Peter. Elizabeth’s four children have given her a total of eight grandchildren, who have been followed by several great-grandchildren.Princess Diana’s death. In a rare televised broadcast ahead of Diana’s funeral in 1997, Queen Elizabeth remembered the Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris at age 36, as “an exceptional and gifted human being.”Golden jubilee. In 2002, celebrations to mark Elizabeth II's 50 years as queen culminated in a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace in the presence of 12,000 cheering guests, with an estimated one million more watching on giant screens set up around London.A trip to Ireland. In May 2011, the queen visited the Irish Republic, whose troubled relationship with the British monarchy spanned centuries. The trip, infused with powerful symbols of reconciliation, is considered one of the most politically freighted trips of Elizabeth’s reign.Breaking a record. As of 5:30 p.m. British time on Sept. 9, 2015, Elizabeth II became Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Elizabeth was 89 at the time, and had ruled for 23,226 days, 16 hours and about 30 minutes.Marking 70 years of marriage. On Nov. 20, 2017, the queen and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th anniversary, becoming the longest-married couple in royal history. The two wed in 1947, as the country and the world was still reeling from the atrocities of World War II.Losing her spouse. In 2021, Queen Elizabeth II bade farewell to Prince Philip, who died on April 9. An image of the queen grieving alone at the funeral amid coronavirus restrictions struck a chord with viewers at home following the event.Public viewing areas were set up in parks in London and other cities, and people propped up camping chairs, laid out blankets and erected small step stools to see over the people in front of them. But the early festival-like atmosphere became somber when the funeral service began and video was beamed from Westminster Abbey.Anna Stubbens, 29, a doctor in London, said she went to Hyde Park to watch the day’s events on big screens “because it would have been so sad to miss it.” She said she thought of bringing a bottle of champagne, but her fiancé convinced her to leave it. “He said it would be inappropriate,” she said.Those fortunate enough to secure a spot along the procession route settled in for the wait. Some visitors, navigating the chaos of an unfamiliar city, found themselves shunted toward random sections of Hyde Park where tens of thousands watched the service together on the large screens. Many brought food or bought sausages or fish and chips from several food trucks installed for the occasion.“I have cried my eyes out all the way through,” said Jess Parson, 36, wrapped in a Union Jack. “They don’t make them like her anymore. She was a one-off.”The crowd grew hushed as the first chords of a hymn from the funeral echoed out over speakers lining the Mall, the road that runs from Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar Square.One group of women, leaning on metal barricades, clasped their hands as if in prayer. Another woman wept as she sang along with a choir to a hymn that had been part of Elizabeth’s wedding to Philip in 1947, as princess and prince.Others crossed their arms, hugging themselves against the cold.At the end of the ceremony, as two minutes of silence were held, people in the crowd bowed their heads. Children held the hands of their parents. One mother draped her arm over her small son’s shoulder.Enid Reade, 80, and her daughter Ellen Reade, 43, from Lancashire, were among those quietly listening to the hymns filtering out of speakers in Hyde Park.“I’m old enough to remember her promise to the people that she would serve us whether her life was short or long,” the elder Ms. Reade said, referencing a speech the queen gave when she was 21. “I just want to be here.”The funeral gave way to the splendor of a large military procession as the queen’s coffin was moved from Westminster Abbey up the Mall. And the sun made an appearance as brass bands played mournful dirges.As the queen’s coffin — followed closely by the royal family, led by King Charles — passed by, the only noise was the distant thump of drumbeats and the clomp of horses’ hooves. Then, amid the silent march, from one side of the crowd on Horse Guards Road, a single male voice shouted out, “God bless the queen,” as her coffin rolled past.Members of the military in the crowd saluted their one-time commander in chief as the queen’s coffin passed by. Jeff McNally, 63, wore a medal he was awarded in the 1970s, when he served in the Royal Artillery, with Queen Elizabeth’s face on it.“I want to say goodbye to my boss,” he said. “Prime ministers come and go, but she has been the one constant thing in my life.”At the end of the march down the Mall, which had played host to so many of the major ceremonial moments of Queen Elizabeth’s life, her coffin was transferred from the gun carriage to a hearse for a 25-mile trip to Windsor Castle. It gave Londoners another opportunity to catch a final glimpse of the monarch before her reign was relegated to history.Those who couldn’t get a spot at the edge of the pavement as the queen’s hearse drove by scrambled up railings and climbed atop post boxes to get a better look.“You’ll wait for a brief moment — but that moment lasts forever,” said Andrew Lucas, about the hours spent waiting for the coffin to pass by.Mourners also lined roadways to see the hearse roll past. The sky above Hounslow in West London fell unusually quiet during the procession, a rarity for local residents living under the flight path of Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest in the world. The airport said on Thursday that it has rescheduled flights “out of respect” for the queen to ensure the flight path remained quiet over London and Windsor during the ceremony.After the procession passed through one west London neighborhood, the crowd quickly dispersed, and children emerged into the street to play soccer — relishing the unusually empty roads. Street sweepers donned their coveralls, spreading out to pick up discarded bouquets and trash that had been left behind.As the crowds filtered out from the city center, many were reflective or took stock of the event.“I wasn’t interested in seeing the rest of the family, but I was always transfixed by the queen,” said Fiona Russell, 53.The days since the queen’s death had seen much of the rest of the country similarly transfixed, said Robert Scott, also 53. But “the focus once the dust settles this week will be on everything else,” he said.“This whole thing has been a massive distraction,” he said, noting Britain’s political tumult and economic woes. “And I think some leading politicians were probably very relieved.”Emma Bubola, Isabella Kwai and Euan Ward contributed reporting from London. </body>

	<title>Bad Bunny, No. 1 Again, Puts a Spotlight on Inequities in Puerto Rico</title>
	<author>Ben Sisario</author>
	<body>Another week, another hundred-odd-million streams and yet another No. 1 for Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican pop superstar whose album “Un Verano Sin Ti” has dominated the upper rungs of the Billboard chart since it came out in May.In its 19th week of release, “Un Verano” notches an 11th time at No. 1, the most at the top since Drake’s “Views” had a 13-week stint in 2016. The runs for both albums are nonconsecutive, but Bad Bunny has the distinction of never dipping below No. 2. (“Views” fell as low as No. 4 during its first 19 weeks out.)In its most recent week, “Un Verano” had the equivalent of 97,000 sales in the United States, including 132 million streams, according to Luminate, the tracking service that powers Billboard’s charts. Since its release, the album has had the equivalent of about 2.4 million sales, and its songs have racked up 3.3 billion streams.The accomplishment comes as Bad Bunny is selling out stadiums across North America — including two nights at Yankee Stadium last month — and has become increasingly outspoken about political and social issues in Puerto Rico. On Friday, he released a 23-minute video, which segues from a music video for his song “El Apagón” to an 18-minute documentary by Bianca Graulau, a journalist, called “Aquí Vive Gente” (“People Live Here”).Her film looks at inequities in Puerto Rican real estate, including the eviction of some low-income residents of San Juan to make way for million-dollar homes that cater to mainland speculators and cryptocurrency traders. “They’re evicting Puerto Ricans to get rich with what’s from here, with what’s native from here,” one woman, who said she was given 30 days to leave her apartment, tells Graulau in the film.Bad Bunny’s video also explores the longstanding problems with Puerto Rico’s power grid, which has struggled to recover after Hurricane Maria in 2017. Outages this year led to protests against Luma Energy, a private company that took it over in 2021. The video arrived as Hurricane Fiona knocked out power across all of Puerto Rico, and led to widespread flooding.Three new albums placed high on this week’s chart. The Canadian rapper Nav opens at No. 2 with “Demons Protected by Angels,” while Ozzy Osbourne, the 73-year-old metal god and onetime reality-TV star, starts at No. 3 with his latest, “Patient Number 9.” The country singer Kane Brown debuts at No. 5 with “Different Man.”Also this week, Morgan Wallen’s “Dangerous: The Double Album” is No. 4, extending its historic chart run with an 87th time in the Top 10.</body>

	<title>México tiene el tequila. Perú, el pisco. En Colombia, el viche, que ahora es legal</title>
	<author>Julie Turkewitz</author>
	<body>CALI, Colombia — Cuando era niña, Lucía Solís vio cómo su familia enterraba en el bosque un alijo de viche, un licor de caña apreciado pero prohibido, por temor a que la policía lo confiscara e incluso los arrestara.Sin embargo, este mes de agosto se encontraba rodeada de botellas de viche, con su líquido de color ámbar, crema y cristal, abrumada por clientes deseosos de probarlo, ahora que es legal.Estaba vendiendo su propia marca de licor en un puesto de una de las mayores celebraciones de la cultura afrodescendiente en América Latina, el Festival de Música del Pacífico Petronio Álvarez, en el que 350.000 visitantes convierten una amplia franja de Cali en una fiesta gigante.“¡Soy sexta generación!”, gritó Solís, de 56 años, esforzándose por hacerse oír por encima de los sonidos de los bombos de sonido profundo y la marimba melódica mientras explicaba que ella era una más en la larga lista de mujeres que han elaborado viche. “La abuela, la bisabuela, la tatarabuela. Los ancestros”.El viche, hecho de caña de azúcar destilada, fue inventado por personas que fueron esclavizadas en la región de la costa del Pacífico colombiano y ganó popularidad como respuesta casera al monopolio del gobierno sobre el licor de caña, convirtiéndose en una especie de alcohol ilegal colombiano.Se diferencia de otros licores de caña de azúcar, como el aguardiente colombiano, porque la caña debe cultivarse junto al mar o a un río y junto a otras plantaciones autóctonas de la región que, según los productores, dan al viche su característico sabor ahumado y cítrico.Prohibido durante generaciones, el viche se convirtió en un símbolo de la prolongada exclusión de la cultura negra del relato nacional de Colombia, y su veto fue una prueba más, según los críticos, de que el país no reconocía las numerosas contribuciones de la comunidad.El festival Petronio Álvarez es una poderosa respuesta a cualquier intento de ignorar o descartar la cultura afrodescendiente de Colombia. Llamado así por un músico que celebraba su cultura en sus canciones, comenzó en 1997 como un evento musical y ha crecido hasta convertirse en una mezcla de reunión regional, semana de la moda, concursos de chefs, un festival de danza y uno de los conciertos más importantes del año.Para algunos, la asistencia anual es una tradición, algo así como una peregrinación cultural. (El Petronio, como se le llama comúnmente al evento, fue virtual en 2020, en medio de la pandemia, y el año pasado se realizó en un formato reducido).El festival en sí tiene lugar en un complejo deportivo al aire libre, donde un concurso musical que es una especie de Colombian Idol de la Costa del Pacífico otorgó este año uno de sus mayores premios a la banda La Jagua.Pero su legendaria fiesta posterior se extiende a las calles de Cali, y este año hubo una aparición especial de Francia Márquez, la primera vicepresidenta afrocolombiana del país, que, recién llegada de una serie de visitas a presidentes sudamericanos, apareció en un balcón, saludando y mandando besos a una multitud que coreaba su nombre.Después de generaciones en las que los colombianos negros en su mayoría han sido excluidos de las más altas esferas de la política nacional, el reciente ascenso político de Márquez —que nació en la más profunda pobreza y luego se convirtió en abogada y activista medioambiental antes de ganar la vicepresidencia— ha emocionado a muchos votantes.En el festival, la comida y la bebida afrocolombianas son una parte esencial del ambiente, y el viche es el único alcohol permitido en el evento. Los comerciantes que intentan vender cerveza son escoltados hacia afuera por la seguridad.El papel predominante del viche en el festival es aún más notable si se tiene en cuenta su historia al margen de la ley.Pero en 2019, la Corte Constitucional del país dictaminó que una ley que brinda protección a las bebidas ancestrales de las comunidades indígenas debe aplicarse también a las afrocolombianas. Esto allanó el camino para que el Congreso legalizara el viche y lo declarara patrimonio de las comunidades negras del Pacífico colombiano.El año pasado se concedió al viche el estatus de producto de patrimonio cultural.Ahora, Solís y otras personas forman parte de un impulso para convencer a los colombianos de más allá del Pacífico de que adopten el viche como emblema cultural de todo el país.“Perú tiene pisco, México tiene tequila, Escocia tiene whisky”, dijo Manuel Pineda, presidente del capítulo regional de la Asociación de Bares de Colombia. “Nosotros tenemos viche”.El objetivo, dijo, es llegar a ser global.“Es muy importante para nosotros respetar esos abuelos que lo trajeron hasta ahora”, dijo. “Pero lo queremos mostrar al mundo. Queremos que el mundo conozca esta historia”.El ambiente que prevalece en el festival es de exuberancia y orgullo cultural, y los asistentes de todas las razas y orígenes étnicos son bienvenidos.El viche está por todas partes. En botellas en pequeños puestos. Vertido en vasos de plástico de muestra. Se vende en las neveras de los conciertos. Metido en bolsillos y mochilas. Se reparte entre nuevos amigos. Celebrado en todo un pabellón con más de 50 familias productoras de viche, llamadas vicheras.En el primer concurso de viche del Petronio, el ganador fue una mezcla de viche, jerez, licor de naranja y albahaca, jugo de limón y hoja de coca.El licor está en las letras del popular trío de hip-hop ChocQuibTown, que en una noche de sábado de verano llenó una plaza enorme en Cali y abrió su actuación con la canción “Somos Pacífico”, que es tanto una descripción de personalidad pacífica como una definición del origen geográfico. Incluso los policías movían las caderas.El viche se suele mezclar con hierbas, frutas y especias. Una versión llamada tomaseca tiene notas suntuosas de canela y nuez moscada; otra, el arrechón, cremoso y suave como la fruta borojó, se considera un afrodisíaco. El curao se infunde con hierbas como la menta, la manzanilla o el pipilongo, una planta autóctona de la región.“Me parece rica una bebida tan cargada de simbolismo, de valores”, dijo Neila Castillo, de 68 años, quien estaba junto al puesto de Solís probando viches con una amiga de la universidad, Marta Espinosa, de 67 años. Metieron en sus bolsos botellas de viche puro de color blanco claro para disfrutarlas más tarde.En 2008, el viche se convirtió en la bebida oficial del festival cuando los organizadores tomaron la decisión osada de comercializarlo durante el evento como parte de un “ejercicio de sensibilización”, a pesar de que todavía era ilegal, dijo Ana Copete, directora del festival y nieta del músico que lo inspiró. En aquel momento, el viche gozaba de una protección informal en el marco del evento, dijo, y los comerciantes podían vender sus productos sin la interferencia de las autoridades.El viche representa el único ingreso para muchas familias en la región del Pacífico de Colombia, y en 2018, Copete lanzó un esfuerzo de colaboración con los productores para poner la legalización del viche en la agenda pública.El grupo pronto consiguió el apoyo del Ministerio de Cultura de Colombia y de otros responsables políticos que vieron el potencial económico de la bebida.“Ha sido una lucha mantenerla viva, que la tradición no desaparezca”, dijo Copete. Su presencia destacada en el festival, añadió, “permite que otras personas que no son del Pacífico conozcan esta bebida y conozcan lo que representa, la consuman y así ayuden a las familias vicheras”.Solís, la productora de viche, creció con la bebida como parte de la vida cotidiana en Buenaventura, una ciudad portuaria del Pacífico a unos 80 kilómetros de Cali. Se tomaba no solamente como bebida espirituosa, sino también como medicina tradicional utilizada para ayudar en el parto, limpiar las heridas, calmar los dolores menstruales y tratar la infertilidad.Cuando tenía 7 años, su tía le dijo que iba a instruirla en conocimientos locales de más de 300 años de antigüedad. Le tapaba los ojos a la niña con un pañuelo y le enseñaba a identificar las plantas únicamente por su fragancia.Solís fue una de las primeras vicheras en registrar su empresa, Semillas de Vida, ante la autoridad comercial del país, incluso antes de que fuera declarada “patrimonio cultural inmaterial de la nación”.Cuando se enteró del registro, lloró, saltó, gritó, abrazó a su hijo y dio gracias a Dios. El sentimiento, dijo, fue indescriptible.Legalizar y honrar el viche, dijo, “fue una alegría tremenda, porque eso es una lucha de muchos”.Julie Turkewitz es jefa del buró de los Andes, que cubre Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Perú, Surinam y Guyana.

	<title>One Big Problem for Ukraine Is Clear: Glass</title>
	<author>Jeffrey Gettleman</author>
	<body>CHERNIHIV, Ukraine — There was one topic of conversation among the women bundled up in front of a bombed-out building the other day as they waited in a long line at a humanitarian food truck, a nippy wind swirling around them.“When are you going to get your glass?” one asked.“Have you called about the glass?” another said.“It was really cold last night. Didn’t you feel it?” said a third. “When’s the glass coming?”This is becoming a big problem in Ukraine. So many windows have been shattered by explosions — “millions of them,” one humanitarian official estimated — that there is a nationwide run on glass.In the towns and cities that the Russian military has pounded with earthshaking artillery barrages, nothing has been spared — not the high rises, not the schools, not the squat little cottages. Just on Monday, the shock waves from a powerful Russian missile that exploded more than 800 feet from a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine blew out more than 100 of the plant’s windows.This is what has happened to countless people’s homes in the line of fire: They might have been spared a direct hit, but all their windows have been shattered. And winter is coming. Fast.The other week here in Chernihiv, an elegant city in northern Ukraine, the temperature dropped from about 80 degrees Fahrenheit to almost freezing.No doubt that Ukraine is facing a host of crises within crises, but one of the most urgent is the scramble to get damaged homes ready for winter, and that is where the glass comes in.Appreciate this material just for a moment, because hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians really need it right now. Glass lets in light and keeps out cold. You can see through it, so no matter how small or cramped your place is, you have a view. Glass keeps out birds, bugs and dust, and you can open a window and let in fresh air.The alternatives, which you can see all over Ukraine now, have obvious deficiencies.Plywood may cover a hole in the wall, but it leaves the inside space dark, which can be depressing. And the scraps of tablecloths or plastic film that a lot of people are using — one man said he had nothing better than the Ukrainian version of Saran Wrap to cover his windows — might let in sunlight. But they don’t seal well and leave people curled up at night under three blankets, dreading winter.“That stuff?” said Oleksandr Zhyla, a retired architect who used the plastic food wrap on his blown-out windows in Chernihiv. He pointed to his handiwork and laughed: “It doesn’t keep us warm at all.”Even before the Russian invasion in February, Ukraine had glass issues. One of its biggest glass factories was in the eastern Donbas region, but it was bombed during the pro-Russian rebellion there a few years ago, and shut down.That left Ukraine relying heavily on Russia and Belarus for glass. But after this war started, those trade links were cut. So now almost all of Ukraine’s glass, two distributors said, is imported, much of it from pricier European markets.And there are more problems. To make glass, you have to melt sand. And to melt sand, you need a lot of energy. And with global energy prices soaring, glass prices have risen sharply as well.Add all of this up — the higher production costs, the increased demand, Ukraine’s logistical nightmares, like its seaports being blockaded by Russian submarines — and it’s no mystery that an ordinary pane of glass costs double, triple or even quadruple what it used to, according to glass suppliers. That makes it impossible for many people to fix their windows, even as the cold air begins to blow in. And every day, with the fighting still raging, more are being broken.During a war, windows are always the first to go. If a bomb is powerful enough, the shock waves or reverberations will shatter glass far from the explosion, creating a blizzard of potentially lethal shards.“You wouldn’t believe how small the pieces were,” said one woman, Nataliia Medvedok, who sat by a blown-out window in her living room in Chernihiv. She had been hiding in a shelter when her building was hit in March and came back to find the floor covered with pea-sized pieces of super-sharp glass.In June, Zosia Jaworowska, who runs a small nonprofit foundation in Warsaw, asked humanitarian groups in Ukraine what they needed.“They all unanimously said: We need windows,” Ms. Jaworowska said. “That was the most expensive and the least available building material.”She swung into action and raised thousands of dollars to ship windows from Poland to Ukraine.In Chernihiv, a private French aid organization, ACTED, is helping Ms. Medvedok and many others pay for window repair, part of its plan to get people ready for winter.“Everyone is rushing, rushing, rushing to do what we can, right now,” said Frances Oppermann, ACTED’s deputy country director for programs. Winter in Ukraine, she said, is “intense.”It’s also long, nearly half the year, with wintry weather stretching from mid-October to mid-March, and temperatures can plummet to 10 below zero. Fixing windows is part of a broader winterization strategy laid out by aid agencies that includes buying tens of millions of dollars worth of blankets, coats, woolen hats and traditional felt boots.In Chernihiv, which has around 200,000 people, a first look can be deceptive. Gazing across its immense cobblestone town square lined with beautiful old buildings and then seeing people jogging through the parks with their perfectly clipped bushes, it almost looks as if nothing had happened. But then you notice how many windows are boarded up or missing.Chernihiv was blasted by Russian missiles and rockets in March, but has not seen much fighting since then. While there has been a lightning Ukrainian offensive this month that pushed back Russian troops around the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Chernihiv has remained relatively quiet.At the mayor’s office, there is still plywood covering some of the broken windows.“I have bigger problems,” said the mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko. “I can’t have children freezing in their apartments.”His priority is to repair critical infrastructure to ensure the city is ready to turn on the heat when winter arrives, no small feat given the extent of the damage and how expensive energy has become.Mykolaiv, a city in the south, has been shelled mercilessly by Russian forces. Vitaliy Kim, a top local official, said he has 50,000 square meters of windows to fix — that’s almost 10 football fields of glass.“Even the windows in my own house are blown out,” he said.Nationwide, the figures are staggering. Some 140,000 residential buildings have been destroyed; 44 million square meters of housing have been damaged; and millions of Ukrainians are living in homes “ill-suited to provide sufficient protection from harsh winter conditions,” according to the United Nations.Considering that the front line zigzags for more than 1,000 miles and that Russia has hammered hundreds of places with artillery, it’s not hard to see how Ms. Oppermann came to an estimate of “millions” of broken windows. But no one really knows.Mr. Zhyla, the retired architect, went around his blown-out nine-story building in Chernihiv, counting the broken windows. He found 496. And that’s just one building.He is worried that if the windows are not fixed by wintertime, the pipes in his building could turn to ice and burst, and then it will be really hard to live there.“A simple $100 window can prevent an entire family from freezing this winter,” said Michael Capponi, the founder of Global Empowerment Mission, an aid group that has installed thousands of windows in Ukraine.Viktoriia Markova, whose home in Chernihiv was smashed to smithereens by an artillery shell, was recently given a small shelter in her backyard for her, her husband and teenage son. It is the size of an ordinary bedroom, and its walls are made of the same material as a porta-potty.It’s dark and stuffy inside and smells like plastic. And it doesn’t have any real windows.“It’s not great,” Ms. Markova conceded. “But there’s just one thing on everyone’s mind. Victory. We’re all just waiting for victory.”Marc Santora contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine, and Oleksandra Mykolyshyn from Chernihiv, Ukraine.</body>

	<title>‘House of the Dragon,’ Season 1, Episode 5 Recap: Wedding Crashers</title>
	<author>Jeremy Egner</author>
	<body>It’s not a real Westeros wedding until somebody starts screaming.Actually the wedding of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Ser Laenor Velaryon hadn’t even begun when the wailing started, as the Rehearsal Dinner from Seven Hells erupted into paramour-on-paramour violence. By the time it was over, Joffrey (Solly McLeod), Laenor’s portentously named sparring partner, lay dead on the ballroom floor with a face like a collapsed Jell-O mold, and Ser Criston was ready to fall on his blade.They were the latest victims of Rhaenyra and Daemon’s big night out on the Street of Silk, the repercussions of which continue to reverberate throughout the realm. Last week, the fallout enveloped Otto, fired for revealing the transgressions to the king; Rhaenyra, finally cornered into a forced marriage; and Daemon, banished yet again (only to return yet again).This week the toll was more lethal. Ser Joffrey was joined in death by the bronze bride, Lady Rhea (Rachel Redford), after Daemon decided killing his wife was preferable to settling down with her. (Contrary to what we’ve heard, she was quite comely, but Targaryens prefer blondes. And relatives.) Those losses, in turn, upended the lives of Laenor, the grieving groom, and Rhea’s cousin, Ser Gerold Royce.Meanwhile, the slithery Larys Strong (Matthew Needham), who might as well have been wearing a sign around his neck that said “Sinister Schemer,” was igniting the embers of Alicent’s suspicion in the royal garden. I heard the princess was delivered some definitely-not-morning-after tea the other day, he told her, I hope she’s OK.The revelation and Ser Criston’s ensuing admission sent Alicent in search of a Hightower Green wedding-crashing dress, which she debuted with a resolute elegance that seems sure to make her father proud. Her strut through the ballroom, in the middle of the king’s speech, doubled as a statement of allegiance in the Iron Throne derby at the heart of this story. Spoiler alert: it’s not to the side that was hosting the wedding.All of which is to say: The scandal that began in that pleasure house is well on its way to enveloping everyone in the realm.One thing I’ve always enjoyed about George R.R. Martin’s storytelling is the way its momentous, world-changing events erupt from recognizable human impulses and flaws — jealousy, lust, insecurity, the desire to protect your family or conceal your shameful secrets. The sordid but genuine love between Cersei and Jaime Lannister animated “Game of Thrones”; the Red Wedding was revenge for a broken engagement; Daenerys’s sense of deep grievance drove her to traverse the globe and commit mass murder. (OK, her impulses and flaws were less recognizable than others …)Similarly, the current throne battle was set up by Viserys’s stubborn, perhaps misguided loyalty to his daughter, borne of his grief over his wife. Now the fallout from Daemon’s lust and desire to strike back at his brother, paired with Rhaenyra’s selfish recklessness and dishonesty, has seemingly deepened the primary rift to an irreparable degree.Did you buy it? Alicent’s stridency seemed extreme in someone who has so far been circumspect and accommodating, particularly since it seemed motivated by the fact that Rhaenyra misled her — hardly a capital offense, but perhaps it represented the final break between the former friends. Otto also terrified her on his way out of town, with his warnings about the near future and the safety of her children, should Rhaenyra remain heir. Apparently all of the above, combined with the stark reality of Viserys’s ongoing circling of the royal drain, compelled her to conspicuously stand tall, as her uncle put it.Less convincing was the collapse of Ser Criston, who went from stalwart defender to violent basket case within a week or so. (The timeline was a little fuzzy this episode.)I guess we’re supposed to believe that Criston had been pushed past his limit: His dalliance with Rhaenyra, in breaking his Kingsguard chastity oath, shattered his self-image, and the princess compounded matters by rejecting his marriage plan and dismissing his dreams of Essos as little more than “a bushel of oranges.” The queen already knows all about his soiled cloak, thanks to his sitcom-level misunderstanding of her query about the Silk Street night. Perhaps learning that the snide Joffrey knew too, that this secret would hang over him forever, was more than Criston could bear. The only solution, apparently, was to beat the man to death on the dance floor.The speed and scale of Criston’s decline strained credulity. Maybe he was just that desperate to keep the secret hidden, though the mania of his attack suggested a kind of psychic break. Maybe another motivating factor will be revealed in the future. But from a narrative standpoint, the bludgeoning foreshadowed future bloodshed as it illustrated the unintended consequences of the royals’ actions and heedlessness.Based on Daemon’s advice, Rhaenyra thought she’d be able to have her wedding cake and boy-toy too. (She promised Laenor something similar.) What she got instead was a marriage ceremony that was terrible even by Westeros standards, with rotting food on the tables, a passed-out dad and rats licking up the blood of her new husband’s freshly murdered lover. And said boy-toy has now been claimed by her rival, who presumably plans to turn him into a different kind of plaything.So … congratulations?What do we think Viserys actually has, anyway? Any guesses? I tried entering “nose bleeds, fatigue, fainting, shortness of breath, nausea, open lesions and fingers falling off” into WebMD but no dice. Whatever he’s suffering from, thank goodness the Grand Maester was around to reject the maester intern’s herbal poultice in favor of another leeching. (For what it’s worth, Paddy Considine has said the king has “a form of leprosy.”)Now I feel bad about joking about Lady Rhea’s invisibility last week — no doubt she preferred it to what befell her on Sunday. While Daemon’s bloody campaign against King’s Landing criminals was cruel in its extremes, his apparent murder of his wife revealed a capacity for calculated evil.Rhea’s mocking question about whether Daemon was ready to finally consummate their marriage raised a couple of additional questions: One, does that mean his, uh, performance issues are a longstanding condition? I attributed his abandonment of Rhaenyra last week to a “crisis of conscience,” but in the aftershow segment, the “Dragon” creative team blamed impotence. We also saw his frustrations in the brothel in the premiere. Two, if Daemon never consummated the marriage, is he still entitled to Runestone and whatever else comprises the bronze bride’s estate?Somebody should probably warn Laena Velaryon (Savannah Steyn), last seen flirting with Daemon on the dance floor. She’s grown up, somewhat, and when wheezy old Viserys showed up at her house, she had to be thinking she dodged a bullet by not marrying him back when she was 12. She should dodge this one, too. (But probably won’t.)I assume the awful, rat-infested state of the ballroom during Rhaenyra and Lenore’s nuptials symbolized the bloody wreckage that will continue to result from this pairing, as predicted by Rhaenys. (“We are placing our son in danger,” she told the Sea Snake.) But come on, a castle full of servants couldn’t tidy up a little for the princess’ sad pop-up wedding?In case it wasn’t clear, Larys Strong is the son of Lyonel Strong (Gavin Spokes), the new Hand of the King, and brother to Harwin (Ryan Corr), the strapping fellow who carried Rhaenyra away from the wedding melee. Given Larys’s apparent Hightower loyalties and his father’s obligations to Viserys, things in House Strong could get complicated.“So you want me to be your whore,” Ser Criston said, incredulously if succinctly boiling down Rhaenyra’s post-wedding plans. Taking things out of their usual context invites you to consider them anew. Criston’s shock and shame reminds us about all the times we’ve unthinkingly watched women be used in similar fashion on “Game of Thrones” and a hundred other shows.Finally, Sunday’s episode was the last one for Milly Alcock and Emily Carey, who will be replaced next week by Emma D’Arcy, as Rhaenyra, and Olivia Cooke, as Alicent. Consider the job these young women were given: To anchor, alongside far more seasoned actors, the high-stakes follow-up to the biggest hit HBO has ever had, in front of a global audience of many millions. They handled it with an impressive amount of talent and grace. I’m excited to see what they do next.What do you think? Do Rhaenyra and Laenor have any future at all? Is Alicent officially off on her own Hightower power trip? How many fingers would you have to lose before alerting Westeros’s Centers for Disease Control? Fire away with whatever remaining digits you have in the comments.</body>

	<title>Queen Elizabeth: A Visual Dictionary</title>
	<author>Louis Lucero II</author>
	<body>Over her seven decades on the throne, Queen Elizabeth II understood the power of visuals. The first British monarch to have a televised coronation, she watched the world turn its attention from the radio to the TV set, and by the time she died this month at 96, having celebrated her Platinum Jubilee just a few months earlier, she — well, the royal family — had an Instagram account and a YouTube channel.As she presided over a shrinking empire, projecting stability and continuity was arguably her most essential job as sovereign. From her hairstyle to her handbags, her kerchiefs to her corgis, her pearls to her profile, every visual signifier was a means of communication for a monarch who famously had little to say — at least in public. Here’s a look at the symbols Elizabeth leveraged during her historic reign, and what she used them to say.Her hairQueen Elizabeth II was nothing if not steadfast in her devotion to her country and the style in which she chose to express it, but of all the consistent imagery she created throughout her long life, her carefully sculpted hairstyle might have been the most reliable of all.From the time she was a girl pictured in black and white on the lawn through her stint in the Auxiliary Territorial Service and then her marriage, coronation and 70 years of rule, through decades of bobs, bouffants, hippie hair and helmet heads, it never really changed: an inch or two shorter or longer here, maybe; slightly more bouffant there; allowed to go white in the 1990s, sure. But otherwise her ’do — chin-length, brushed back at the crown, set in soft curls at either temple and framing her jawline — was the visual equivalent of death and taxes: a rock of reliability in an uncertain world. And like so much about the queen, it was a highly considered choice.Perfectly and deliberately symmetrical, so that she looked the same from either side and in every portrait; molded to fit snugly under a crown or one of her many hats and scarves, her coif was tended to for over two decades by the hairdresser Ian Carmichael, who visited Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle twice a week until the coronavirus pandemic (when Angela Kelly, the queen’s personal assistant and senior dresser, took over) to make sure there was not a strand out of place. That was just how she rolled.— Vanessa FriedmanHer handbags“She told me she never felt dressed without her bag,” Gerald Bodmer said of Queen Elizabeth II. Mr. Bodmer, 90, is the chief executive of Launer, a British manufacturer of luxury leather goods favored by the queen for her most ever-present accessories: her handbags. (According to Town &amp; Country, her first Launer bag was a gift from her mother decades ago.)The bags were sturdy, unflashy and constant to an almost metaphorical degree. One of her favorites, Mr. Bodmer said, was the Traviata, a trapezoidal bag made of suede-lined calfskin with a single top strap; the queen sported it in both black leather and the slightly more fanciful black patent leather. It retails for about $2,800. She crashed the Launer website after carrying a cream-colored Lisa — a boxier handbag with two straps — at the 2011 wedding of William and Catherine, now the Prince and Princess of Wales.The queen was also known for customizing the bags to her liking, preferring longer-than-standard straps. In recent years, Launer took steps to make them lighter for the queen, removing excess materials from the interior for easier carrying, Mr. Bodmer said. “Right to the end of her life, she was carrying a handbag, even when using a walking stick,” he said. “You can’t have a more loyal customer, can you?”— Madison Malone KircherHer glovesQueen Elizabeth II was known for her restraint. She rarely showed excitement or worry (“Keep calm and carry on,” etc.). She also rarely showed her hands.The queen almost always wore gloves in public, whether white dress gloves or black leather ones. She waved from balconies and carriages in them, and shook hands in private receiving lines and at public walkabouts with fully sheathed fingers.“Gloves were a physical barrier between the queen and her subjects,” said Elizabeth Holmes, a journalist who has written widely about the royals. “They projected a certain separation between a monarch and the people.”Becoming queen. Following the death of King George VI, Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary ascended to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, at age 25. The coronation of the newly minted Queen Elizabeth II took place on June 2 the following year.A historic visit. On May 18, 1965, Elizabeth arrived in Bonn on the first state visit by a British monarch to Germany in more than 50 years. The trip formally sealed the reconciliation between the two nations following the world wars.First grandchild. In 1977, the queen stepped into the role of grandmother for the first time, after Princess Anne gave birth to a son, Peter. Elizabeth’s four children have given her a total of eight grandchildren, who have been followed by several great-grandchildren.Princess Diana’s death. In a rare televised broadcast ahead of Diana’s funeral in 1997, Queen Elizabeth remembered the Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris at age 36, as “an exceptional and gifted human being.”Golden jubilee. In 2002, celebrations to mark Elizabeth II's 50 years as queen culminated in a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace in the presence of 12,000 cheering guests, with an estimated one million more watching on giant screens set up around London.A trip to Ireland. In May 2011, the queen visited the Irish Republic, whose troubled relationship with the British monarchy spanned centuries. The trip, infused with powerful symbols of reconciliation, is considered one of the most politically freighted trips of Elizabeth’s reign.Breaking a record. As of 5:30 p.m. British time on Sept. 9, 2015, Elizabeth II became Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Elizabeth was 89 at the time, and had ruled for 23,226 days, 16 hours and about 30 minutes.Marking 70 years of marriage. On Nov. 20, 2017, the queen and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th anniversary, becoming the longest-married couple in royal history. The two wed in 1947, as the country and the world was still reeling from the atrocities of World War II.Losing her spouse. In 2021, Queen Elizabeth II bade farewell to Prince Philip, who died on April 9. An image of the queen grieving alone at the funeral amid coronavirus restrictions struck a chord with viewers at home following the event.Amid a pandemic, it doesn’t seem like the worst idea, particularly when part of your job is to extend your hand to strangers so they can curtsy to you. But her gloves weren’t just a modern practicality — they were a commitment to the past, according to Tina Brown, author of “The Palace Papers.” “The queen came from an era where gloves were the norm, and they added a formal finish to everything she wore,” Ms. Brown said.A notable break from the royal tradition of gloves came in 1987, when Diana, then the Princess of Wales, shook hands with AIDS patients without gloves. Diana’s bare skin became a symbol of humanity and compassion and offered a contrast to the remoteness conveyed by the gloved hand that the world was at that point extending to people with H.I.V.— Katherine RosmanHer pearlsLong before there was Instagram, there was Queen Elizabeth II, keeping a careful eye and a (usually) steady grip on the brand of her ancestors’ start-up, the Firm. She was, essentially, its chief influencer, and she seemed to know that consistent visuals were vital to building a brand identity.One item that could reliably be seen framing the lower portion of an Elizabeth close-up (no filter necessary) was a pearl necklace — sometimes a double strand, but usually a triple. In portraits, on official state visits, after services at Westminster Abbey, the pearls were there: formal but not fancy, lustrous in glow but not ostentatious in sparkle.When members of the royal family traveled to Buckingham Palace last week to receive the queen’s coffin as it arrived from Scotland, pearls emerged as an item of poignant homage. Cameras captured Catherine, the Princess of Wales, riding in a car toward the palace with a sad, tired gaze cast out the window and a triple-strand pearl necklace draped below her neck.According to Elizabeth Holmes, author of “HRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style,” pearls are a way for anyone to honor the queen. “The pearls don’t have to be real, they don’t have to be expensive — you can do it, too,” she said. “I think we will see more of it.”— Katherine RosmanHer Land RoversPeering over the wheel of a Land Rover, perhaps the make most closely associated with her reign, the queen offered a master class in loyalty to a quintessentially British brand as well as the occasional glimpse, through an untinted window, of her moments of independence.While the queen’s official duties often kept her in prim pumps in the rear seat of a Daimler limousine, in her personal life she charted her own rugged excursions around the Sandringham and Balmoral Estates from the driver’s seat of a Land Rover Defender. The boxy utility vehicles, which have four-wheel drive and the ground clearance to crawl over rocks and ford streams, matched the unfussy capability of a monarch who trained in driving and maintaining military vehicles with the Auxiliary Territorial Service at the end of World War II.“It embodied everything that was British tradition: solid, reliable, not particularly showy or extravagant,” Patrick Collins, research and inquiries officer at the National Motor Museum Trust in Britain, said of the Rover brand. In 1953, when Land Rover was only five years old, the queen rode in a Series 1 on her first royal tour after her coronation; last year, she drove herself to the Royal Windsor Horse Show in a third-generation Range Rover.As her reign entered the internet era, widely circulated images of Elizabeth looking unamused behind the wheel of a hulking Range Rover earned her a new crown: meme queen. With captions like “current mood” and “they see me ruling, they hating,” pictures of the royal vehicles contributed to an impression that the queen was someone who kept her eyes on the road, and the haters in the rearview.— Callie HoltermannHer corgisWhen Clay Bennett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for The Chattanooga Times Free Press, was brainstorming ideas for how best to address and mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II, he initially considered drawing her gloves or a fancy hat. Then he settled on the one characteristic that he felt most connected him to the monarch: a shared love of dogs. In the queen’s case, a love of her corgis, specifically.In a heart-rending image that was widely shared on social media and international television, Mr. Bennett drew an unattended corgi — the end of its leash fallen to the ground — with the dog’s neck turned, looking for its person. The caption reads simply, “Queen Elizabeth II 1926-2022.” “I wanted to draw a corgi as a symbol of the U.K.,” Mr. Bennett said in an interview.Elizabeth was an 18-year-old princess when she received her first beloved corgi, Susan, the progenitor of all her corgis (and dorgis, after a dachshund made its way into the lineage) to come. In the years and decades since, the queen was frequently photographed walking the grounds of one castle or another with her corgis, the most loyal of her loyal subjects.The queen was rarely witnessed publicly meting out affection or familial care. But when she walked with her corgis, she provided a touchstone for people all over the world to connect with the most remote and private of global leaders.“They humanized her,” said the journalist Elizabeth Holmes, who has also written for The New York Times. “But they also allowed her to be human.”— Katherine RosmanHer walking sticksLast year, while attending a service at Westminster Abbey, Queen Elizabeth II used a walking stick publicly for the first time in 17 years. (She was last seen using a walking stick after having knee surgery in 2003.)From then on, a walking stick regularly made an appearance in the monarch’s hand.Among the most recognizable were one that belonged to her husband, Prince Philip, and another that was a gift from the British Army in honor of her Platinum Jubilee.“It was quite a plain, simple type of stick, but sometimes the simple ones are the most elegant,” said Dennis Wall of Ulverston, England, a former hobbyist whose handmade stick was selected from among nine others commissioned by the army for the queen.In addition to representing the queen’s dedication to her responsibilities as head of the Church of England and the British Armed Forces, the sticks were also symbols of her staying power, said Erin Delaney, a professor at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law who researches the British Constitution.“There is something about fidelity, and that kind of long service and relationship, that speaks to strength, and not frailty,” she said.The queen’s willingness to publicly use a walking stick also made her an emblem of women’s empowerment and what it means to “age gracefully,” said Maria Claver, director of the gerontology program at California State University, Long Beach.“Queen Elizabeth is an example of grace,” Dr. Claver said. “The fact that she has been so active in her role as queen, and that she has shown up, I think that helps people see that this is what aging could be like.”— Isabella PaolettoHer kerchiefsWhen the singer Justin Bieber was photographed wearing a head scarf knotted under his chin at a concert in November, the internet threw one of its periodic tantrums. Accusations that he had appropriated the hijab or mocked Islam were hurled at him from around the world. It did not help that it was far from the first time Mr. Bieber was busted for a cultural misstep. (Remember his cornrows?)What seemed oddest about the brouhaha was that the Canadian-born singer may not, in fact, have been mimicking the hijab so much as following a street-style trend whose unlikely originator was the British monarch. For decades, Queen Elizabeth II was routinely photographed during downtime — mounted on horseback, hiking at her 50,000-acre Scottish estate or picnicking with her family — with a head scarf knotted under her chin. The queen favored scarves that tended to be artfully patterned classic silk squares from the French luxury-goods house Hermès.While few could have anticipated that urban guys would take up a style worn without controversy by middle-aged ladies to protect their hair, that is exactly what happened. Over the past several years, young men in cities everywhere appeared with Hermès chin-tied head scarves worn granny-style. Did they intend any disrespect to the hijab? Were they flouting gender norms? Or were they aping Elizabeth? We will probably never know. When it comes to influences, both fashion and Justin Bieber are eternally and blissfully happy in their ignorance.— Guy TrebayHer broochesIn the early 1950s, when the queen acceded to the throne, brooches were a fashionable piece of jewelry that became a part of her formula for dressing. “It was always in the same position above the heart,” Marion Fasel, a jewelry historian, said. And although they’ve “pretty much fallen out of favor,” Ms. Fasel said, the queen was certainly no trend follower, as brooches remained a fixture of her wardrobe for decades.There is a story behind how each brooch in her extensive collection came into the queen’s possession, and she wore each one with intention.“Her choice of brooch was never random,” said Bethan Holt, author of “The Queen: 70 Years of Majestic Style.” “They would be selected for the added meaning they would bring to the moment.”Elizabeth often received brooches as gifts from world leaders, and she wore them while attending events hosted by those leaders’ countries as a sign of friendship and loyalty. Other times, she wore a brooch commemorating a loved one who had given it to her. She also used their colors to convey a message, as she did with her other fashion choices.For her first public appearance after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, for instance, she wore a gold Andrew Grima brooch encrusted with diamonds and rubies that Philip had given her. And during a visit from President Donald J. Trump in 2018, she wore a brooch that had been given to her by former President Barack Obama.— Sadiba HasanHer paletteNothing that the queen wore was a mistake. Everything was forensically and meticulously planned according to occasion, duty, hosts, guests, custom and formality — including her bold choice of color palette.“She wore bright colors because she believed it was her duty to be seen by the people who waited, wet and cold, behind barriers for hours at a time,” wrote Sali Hughes, author of “Our Rainbow Queen,” a book divided into color-blocked chapters that chart the assorted hues Her Majesty would wear from head to toe, allowing her to stand out in a crowd.And so over the seven decades of her rule, there she was, come rain or shine. Visiting a school or a hospital or a world leader, sporting tailored coats, dresses and skirt suits (never trousers) in lemon yellows and letterbox reds, dusky pinks and royal purples and — famously, for her 90th birthday — a deliciously vivid neon green. Angela Kelly, the queen’s senior dresser, explained in 2019 that given Britain’s regular showers, the queen even had a collection of clear umbrellas with a range of different color trims to match her outfits. After all, when it came to her wardrobe, nothing was left to chance — or dictated by passing trends.“The queen and queen mother do not want to be fashion setters,” said Norman Hartnell, the British couturier who designed the queen’s coronation gown. “That’s left to other people with less important work to do.”— Elizabeth PatonHer likenessFor all the queen’s carefully chosen totems of power, it was perhaps one she couldn’t choose — her face — that bonded her most deeply with her public. And she knew it. “I have to be seen to be believed,” the queen reportedly said, recognizing that her image itself was currency — and not just on currency, as she became the first monarch to appear on British bank notes, in 1960.The stoic three-quarter portrait precipitated a series of updated likenesses throughout the years, featuring nearly identical angling but with a gradually pronounced smile. (The last portrait, still in use, was created for the 1990 five-pound note by Roger Withington, when the queen was 64.)The first stamp bearing the queen’s image, based on her first official portraits, by the photographer Dorothy Wilding, was issued in 1952, but it is her left-facing profile by Arnold Machin that has remained frozen in time since its release on June 5, 1967. “It is thought that this design is the most reproduced work of art in history,” according to Buckingham Palace, with over 200 billion copies made.Consistency might have been key in ensuring dominion over the Commonwealth, but it was the evolution of the queen’s likeness that ultimately humanized her. As a modern monarch growing up before the camera, she maintained a rare place in the public imagination, and fashionable photographers such as Norman Parkinson, Lord Snowdon (the queen’s onetime brother-in-law) and, perhaps most significantly, Cecil Beaton helped burnish and brand it.As with all successful brands, the opportunities for product were endless (and sometimes egregious). This year, the Platinum Jubilee occasioned the release of a collectible Queen Elizabeth II Barbie doll, limited-edition bottles of Moët &amp; Chandon, and even a jaunty white Swatch watch bearing a cartoon queen and one of her corgis.

	<title>Waving Goodbye to ‘Dear Evan Hansen’</title>
	<author>Sarah Bahr</author>
	<body>Sam Primack almost made it.“All I see is sky …” he sang. Then the actor, who was playing Evan Hansen on Broadway, paused, looked out at the 1,025 faces in the sold-out Music Box Theater. He shifted. Choked up. Looked down.“… for forever,” he finished, wiping back a tear as he let out the final two words of the show. It was the closing night of “Dear Evan Hansen,” the musical about a socially awkward teenager who tells a terrible lie.The audience — including superfans in striped blue polos; a handful of first-timers with suitcases who’d arrived straight from the airport; the musical’s creators, Benj Pasek, Justin Paul and Steven Levenson; and its director, Michael Greif — broke into a thunderous round of applause. (Five Evans — Andrew Barth Feldman, Stephen Christopher Anthony, Jordan Fisher, Michael Lee Brown and Zachary Noah Piser — arrived onstage later for a final bow.) Since its Broadway debut on Nov. 14, 2016, and with Sunday’s performance, “Dear Evan Hansen” had been seen by more than 1.5 million theatergoers and played 1,699 total performances.“I feel very loved,” a smiling Primack, 21, said in his dressing room after the show. Looking dapper in a maroon suit, he was clutching one of the bouquets of white hydrangeas given to cast members onstage after the performance.“Dear Evan Hansen,” which won the Tony Award for best new musical in 2017, had its world premiere at Arena Stage in Washington in 2015, followed by an Off Broadway run at Second Stage Theater before a Broadway transfer. It went on to win six Tonys, as well as a Grammy Award for its cast album, and the Olivier Award for best new musical for the London production.But, like other long-running shows that restarted after the pandemic, it faced a new challenge: Tourists and international audiences that had not yet fully returned. In June, its producers announced that the curtain would soon come down for the final time; the West End production in London will also close in October, but the North American tour will continue. (Most recently, “The Phantom of the Opera” announced on Friday that it would close next year after 35 years.)“I’d like to blame it on Covid, I really would,” Stacey Mindich, the musical’s lead producer, wrote in an essay for American Theater magazine earlier this week. “But perhaps our story was too emotional for these already difficult times. Perhaps the poorly reviewed film of the same name diminished our audience. Perhaps it was just our time.”It was a bit of a cruel twist for Primack, whose casting was announced in February — before the show had set a closing date — and who took over the role less than two weeks ago, on Sept. 6. Though he began his career, when he was 17, as an understudy in the Broadway production for all three of the male leads — Evan, Connor Murphy and Jared Kleinman — and then joined the national tour as the Evan alternate, he got to play Evan just 12 times on the Broadway stage this month before clearing the rack of polo shirts out of his dressing room.“It’s been unexpectedly short, but also, I’m happy that this is the way that it’s ending,” Primack said before the show, seated in his dressing room surrounded by a red Upstate &amp; Chill sticker, the book “Creativity, Inc.,” by the Pixar Animation co-founder Ed Catmull, and a closet cracked open to reveal a rack of striped blue polos.In an interview before that performance, and then in a brief conversation afterward — he had an after-party to get to, after all! — Primack, who grew up in Scottsdale, Ariz., reflected on being the final actor to play Evan on Broadway, how his own experiences with bullies informed his performance and whether Evan is a good person. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.You clearly had a lot of supporters in the house tonight. Who all did you invite?My whole family — my grandparents, my whole team, some of whom had never seen me perform before. And my teachers from high school are here.Were you a fan of the show before you were cast?I remember staying up until midnight knowing that the cast recording was going to come out, not even knowing what the show was about. I had heard “Waving Through a Window” and I was intrigued. I begged my mom to come to New York to see it, and I saw it with the original cast and got to meet Ben [Platt] afterward. I remember saying to all my friends, “I would love to be in this show more than anything,” so closing it feels like coming full circle.What’s the most challenging part of the show?The last 30 minutes, Evan gets to a real desperate and ugly and scary place that every night is a challenge. He is at a point where he will really do anything.What’s the best advice a former Evan has given you?Just breathe. Because you’re out there by yourself a lot of the time in these really dark scenarios, your mind can wander into really dark places.Can you personally relate to Evan?I was in high school when the show came out, so I know what it was like, and what it’s still like, to go through this age of social media where everyone feels disconnected and people are putting on a front online. And I also have family members — and myself — who go through anxiety.How did you put your own stamp on the role?In middle school, I used to wear these really big shirts and I would pull on them a lot to hide myself from the bullies at school. And I fidget with my hands a lot, both of which are things I tried to bring in.Would you be friends with Evan?I would hope so — I was a theater kid in high school, so I always felt like I was on the outside looking in.Is he a good person?I don’t think people are good or bad. I think all people are flawed, and so is Evan.Why do you think the show resonates with people?People see themselves in the characters, and not just Evan. This is the first time a piece of theater has really touched on suicide and mental health and the stigmas around them. After the show, I have gotten a copious amount of “Thank you for seeing me, thank you for understanding me” messages. Or “This show has made me open up conversations with my own family.” That’s what kept me going for the last three and a half years.What’s next for you?I don’t know! I have to, for the first time since I got this, go back to auditioning, go back to all the hardships of being a working actor. But I’m really excited for the future and am just really happy that this show has propelled me to be able to get in some doors.If we looked in on Evan on his 27th birthday, what would he be doing?I hope that he’s still writing; I hope that he’s at a place in life where he knows that he can keep going forward. I think he ends the show in a place where he starts to learn that, but I hope that, 10 years down the line, he does really understand that things can get better.Let’s do a quick round of confirm or deny.OK!Evan is a Hufflepuff.Confirm.You have a striped polo in your closet.I do own a polo, but I don’t know if it’s striped.You use a saw to get the cast off your arm at intermission.Yes, thank goodness the dressers are also good at their jobs because we haven’t had an injury yet.The best song in the show is “You Will Be Found.”Oh, no, I think the best song is “For Forever.” It’s the first time we get to see Evan let go and be happy.When you saw the trailer for the film, you thought Ben Platt was wearing a wig.No comment!Given a choice, you would see “Hamilton” over “Dear Evan Hansen.”You can’t do that! But, I mean, I’d love to see “Hamilton” again — I’ve seen this show a thousand times. [Laughs]</body>

	<title>As Judge Pursues Maris, He’s Chasing a Triple Crown as Well</title>
	<author>James Wagner</author>
	<body>MILWAUKEE — A funny thing happened on Aaron Judge’s way to hitting a ton of home runs: a ballooning batting average and a second, different chase at history.Judge has spent most of the season on pace to threaten Roger Maris’s American League record of 61 home runs in a season, set in 1961. With two home runs in Sunday’s 12-8 win over the Milwaukee Brewers, Judge’s season total reached 59 — 20 more than any other batter in the major leagues.But as Judge, 30, has racked up the home runs in the second half of the season — 26 since the All-Star break in mid July — he has crept up the A.L.’s batting leaderboard as well. With a torrid .491 batting clip (27-for-55) this month, Judge has put himself in contention to claim a triple crown, an impressive feat in which a batter leads his league in batting average, home runs and runs batted in.With two and a half weeks left in the regular season, Judge holds huge leads in both home runs and R.B.I. The closest A.L. batter in home runs is Houston’s Yordan Alvarez, with 37 — 22 behind Judge — while Cleveland’s José Ramírez is second in R.B.I., but his 112 are 15 behind Judge.After collecting four hits on Sunday, Judge was closing in the third triple crown category. His .316 average was tied with Boston’s Xander Bogaerts for second in the A.L., trailing only Minnesota’s Luis Arráez, at .317.“That’s remarkable,” said Yankees ace Gerrit Cole of Judge, adding later, “It’s the greatest offensive season that I’ve personally ever witnessed. I don’t know what else to say. It’s wonderful.”A triple crown is such a rare achievement in the American and National leagues that a group of only 10 players accounts for the 12 triple crowns. The last person to accomplish the feat — Miguel Cabrera, in 2012 — was the first to do it in over four decades. Yet this year, both leagues have the potential to add another to the list: Judge and, less so, Paul Goldschmidt of the St. Louis Cardinals, who is second in the N.L. in batting average (.322), tied for third in home runs (35) and second in R.B.I. (112).“He’s really just amazing,” said Yankees first baseman Anthony Rizzo of Judge. Alluding to Cabrera, Rizzo added, “Miggy was the last one to do it and the numbers he put up were astronomical and Aaron is blowing that away right now. We haven’t seen it in this game in a long time and for him to be doing it during this era of baseball is just incredible.”Judge’s previous career high in batting average was .287 and he had hit higher than .280 only twice in his six seasons. Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said he had never given much thought to Judge winning a batting title, but he knew that Judge took a lot of pride in hitting for a high average. He added, “So when you consider what he’s doing and the person and his talent, nothing is surprising.”Asked if winning a batting title or triple crown were ever among his dreams growing up, Judge smiled and said, “You set personal goals, especially as a 10-year-old kid. You have dreams and aspirations of what you want to try to accomplish in Major League Baseball if you ever get there. But never in your wildest dreams do you think it’d ever come true. You hope, you pray, you work, but you never know if it’s going to happen until it does.”When Cabrera won the triple crown, Judge was a sophomore at Fresno State University, still a year away from being a first-round pick by the Yankees. His head coach at the time, Mike Batesole, made the entire team watch a YouTube video of all of Cabrera’s 205 hits. “It was a long video,” Judge said, laughing.“It was well worth the watch,” he continued. “He really hammered home just how simple he makes everything. He doesn’t try to overswing. He doesn’t try to do too much, especially with guys on base, you see him poke a single to right field and score two runs. He did the little things in the game and you do that over 162, you’re going to have a pretty good year.”That’s exactly what Judge did in the ninth inning on Sunday. Earlier in the game, he had helped the Yankees come back from a 4-1 deficit. In the third, Judge blasted a sinker from Brewers starter Jason Alexander 414 feet into the second deck in right field. Four innings later, Judge hit the ball even farther, 443 feet, but to the second deck in left field. Perhaps exasperated, Brewers reliever Luis Perdomo threw his arms up just after Judge made contact.When the Brewers tightened things up late, Judge delivered yet again. As he strode to the plate in the ninth inning, Yankees fans at American Family Field chanted “M-V-P!” Judge clobbered the first pitch he saw from side-arming reliever Trevor Kelley toward left field. The crowd cheered then sighed and clapped when the ball bounced in front of the wall for a two-run double. It was the final stroke in a 4-for-5 day, which included a walk and four R.B.I.Afterward, Judge said he wasn’t thinking about a home run but rather driving in more runs. No. 60 will have to wait for another day — the Yankees next play on Tuesday, at home — but Judge, after all, has more than one run at the record books underway.“I understand there’s going to be a story line for the next two weeks on who deserves the M.V.P.,” Rizzo said, then alluding to steroid testing that began in M.L.B. 20 years ago. “But this hasn’t been done in this era, someone chasing 61 clean like this and no real question marks on what’s going on in the game.”As he continued making the case for his teammate, Rizzo referenced Anaheim’s Shohei Ohtani, the two-way star who unanimously won the A.L. Most Valuable Player Award last year and has been even better on the mound this season. “So it’s really impressive. It’s really fun. I know there’s a debate about Ohtani and whatnot, but Judge, it’s his season. He’s having a special season.”</body>

	<title>From Coronation to Funeral: Bookends to the Life of a Queen, and a Generation</title>
	<author>Alan Cowell</author>
	<body>LONDON — It has become a kind of badge of honor among baby boomers to recall how they watched on tiny black-and-white television sets on that day in June 1953, when Elizabeth II was crowned as postwar Britain’s first and thus far only queen.It almost seemed as if an army had gathered around grainy screens set in walnut cabinets to follow the coronation, enthralled by the harnessing of old tradition to the miracle of new technology that became such a hallmark of the second Elizabethan era.Then, on Monday, with lives fast-forwarded into a time of huge flat screens, and bright streaming images on smartphones and tablets, and with their numbers depleted by the years, they watched again, this time to follow her funeral. She had last been seen in public two days before her death on Sept. 8 at her Scottish castle, Balmoral, bowed and frail yet seeming still indomitable.And it seemed, perhaps fancifully, that those two moments had become the bookends of a generation and of a nation’s frayed sense of equilibrium. With her death, a man of that same baby boomer generation, her eldest son, now King Charles III, has assumed the monarch’s role — if not, until his coronation, the crown and scepter — as the anchor of a nation’s identity in troubled times of change and flux.For much of Britain, the queen’s accession to the throne offered a gleam of renascent hope after the depredations of World War II. Both her coronation and funeral unfolded at London’s Westminster Abbey, where, in 1947, she had married Prince Philip, who died in 2021. Her reign of more than 70 years set a record of longevity among British monarchs, reconfirming the notion that the monarchy provides the ballast of her subjects’ sense of continuity.The new king’s rise, by contrast, is set against the tapestry of a pandemic and a new European war in Ukraine. Economies reel from inflation and the uncounted costs of Brexit. The question that has not really been asked in this time of national grief is whether the anchor will slip and a perilous drift will begin.I saw the queen’s coronation at the home of a work-friend of my parents in blue-collar Salford, near Manchester, at one of those prefabricated bungalows that freckled Britain in the wake of the war. I was 6. The queen was 27. (King Charles was then 4.)Of course, as a Briton, I am aware of the narrow line, often overstepped, between whimsy and mawkishness. But it was tempting, watching the state funeral and recalling the coronation, to marvel at the newness, the brightness of that moment in 1953, when even the possibilities of life had yet to be revealed to this British schoolboy.Who would have known then that a life would — or could — unfold in such primary colors of achievement, advance and loss? And who knows now what the legacy of it all would turn out to be? On the radio on Monday, someone quoted the poet John Donne’s injunction to ask not for whom the bell tolls, because “it tolls for thee.” But what is the bell saying?Becoming queen. Following the death of King George VI, Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary ascended to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, at age 25. The coronation of the newly minted Queen Elizabeth II took place on June 2 the following year.A historic visit. On May 18, 1965, Elizabeth arrived in Bonn on the first state visit by a British monarch to Germany in more than 50 years. The trip formally sealed the reconciliation between the two nations following the world wars.First grandchild. In 1977, the queen stepped into the role of grandmother for the first time, after Princess Anne gave birth to a son, Peter. Elizabeth’s four children have given her a total of eight grandchildren, who have been followed by several great-grandchildren.Princess Diana’s death. In a rare televised broadcast ahead of Diana’s funeral in 1997, Queen Elizabeth remembered the Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris at age 36, as “an exceptional and gifted human being.”Golden jubilee. In 2002, celebrations to mark Elizabeth II's 50 years as queen culminated in a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace in the presence of 12,000 cheering guests, with an estimated one million more watching on giant screens set up around London.A trip to Ireland. In May 2011, the queen visited the Irish Republic, whose troubled relationship with the British monarchy spanned centuries. The trip, infused with powerful symbols of reconciliation, is considered one of the most politically freighted trips of Elizabeth’s reign.Breaking a record. As of 5:30 p.m. British time on Sept. 9, 2015, Elizabeth II became Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Elizabeth was 89 at the time, and had ruled for 23,226 days, 16 hours and about 30 minutes.Marking 70 years of marriage. On Nov. 20, 2017, the queen and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th anniversary, becoming the longest-married couple in royal history. The two wed in 1947, as the country and the world was still reeling from the atrocities of World War II.Losing her spouse. In 2021, Queen Elizabeth II bade farewell to Prince Philip, who died on April 9. An image of the queen grieving alone at the funeral amid coronavirus restrictions struck a chord with viewers at home following the event.Watching the funeral it seemed as if a pendulum was swinging between decline and renewal in the natural course of things. But it was hard to define where exactly Britain now stands in the cycle of national life.The event itself played out in choreographed near perfection. Not a soldier in the procession that accompanied the queen’s cortege put a wrong foot forward. Draped in her regal standard, her coffin provided a platform for priceless crown jewels adorning the symbols of monarchy — crown, orb and scepter. The brass shone. The boots glowed. The tunics provided a palette of color. Horses pranced. The coffin itself was mounted on a ceremonial gun carriage pulled along by 142 sailors of the Royal Navy, marching as if one to the solemn strains of a funeral march.It was possible to forget that, as a constitutional monarchy, Britain’s Royal House of Windsor wields only ceremonial powers. In her last public act at Balmoral, the queen presided over the political transition from Boris Johnson to Liz Truss as prime minister. Routinely the monarch holds a private, weekly audience with the prime minister but has little say in the identity of the official, or in the maneuverings that suffused the switch of office holder.But there was a power on display in the solemnity of the service and the sheer spectacle of an event that brought Britons out in the thousands to line the streets, on occasion to cheer, at least to bear witness in reflective silence.And another kind of soft power was on display in a guest list that included world leaders — President Biden among them. Many of those who tried to analyze the event reached for anecdotes reflecting the queen’s less public role as a subtle force promoting the interests of her realm beyond the headline-seeking purview of politicians.In 1957, the queen said in a Christmas broadcast: “It’s inevitable that I should seem a rather remote figure to many of you, a successor to the kings and queens of history.”“I cannot lead you into battle. I do not give you laws or administer justice. But I can do something else. I can give you my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations.” With her astonishing longevity — she was 96 when she died — the queen seemed to keep the promise.In return, her subjects broadly offered their assent. It will be up to Charles now to renew or recast that covenant for an era when, with the queen’s death, Britons might expect a shift toward a newer kind of monarchy, less reliant on the mystique of regal aloofness, more streamlined, readier to wear some of that same heart on the regal sleeve.For those who recalled the grainy screens of coronation day there was something else in play. Stripped away from the overwhelming pomp and pageantry of the funeral, this was a spectacle of raw grief, of loss etched into the faces of her children and their descendants. Princes and princesses could feel pain too.For some it conjured the sense of capricious bereavement that had been visited on those who lost relatives to Covid. Others reached for the memories of loved ones snatched away from them in other ways. The queen’s death turned Britons in on their own losses, evoking thoughts of hoped-for catharsis and closure.Later on Monday, in a second part of the burial rites, held at Windsor Castle west of London — where Elizabeth buried Philip last year — the crown, orb and scepter were finally removed from the coffin, formally separating her from the emblems of earthly power. A high official snapped a symbolic wand and laid it on the coffin in advance of burial. If a transition was to take root, this was where its seed was planted.</body>

	<title>Trump Adviser’s Trial May Shed Light on Foreign Influence Campaigns</title>
	<author>Rebecca Davis O’Brien</author>
	<body>The trial of Thomas J. Barrack Jr., an informal adviser to former President Donald J. Trump accused of acting as an unregistered agent of the United Arab Emirates, could shed light on how foreign governments jockeyed for access to the Trump administration — efforts that may have created lucrative opportunities for businessmen close to the White House.Jury selection for the trial, which is expected to last into October, began Monday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Barrack — a Los Angeles-based private-equity investor — of using his sway with Mr. Trump to advance the interests of the Emiratis and of serving as a secret back channel for communications without disclosing his efforts to the attorney general, as the government contends he should have.While Mr. Barrack served the Emirati government, prosecutors say, he was also seeking money from the rulers for investment funds, including one that would support projects to boost Mr. Trump’s agenda and benefit from his policies.In 2019, prosecutors say, Mr. Barrack repeatedly lied to the F.B.I. about his activities.Mr. Barrack has denied wrongdoing. In court filings, his lawyers have suggested that prosecutors delayed charging him until Mr. Trump left office and said the charges were not supported by facts. A spokesman for Mr. Barrack declined to comment.On his way into the courthouse Monday morning, Mr. Barrack said, “I believe in the system. I believe in the judge, the jury. We’ll see.”Several prospective jurors were dismissed Monday after they expressed strong political sentiment — particularly involving Middle Eastern countries and Mr. Trump.Elaborating on a question from an at-home survey in which jurors were asked to name a famous person they most or least admired, several prospective jurors said Donald Trump. A handful who said they could set aside their personal views and hear the case fairly were allowed to stay.In all, Mr. Barrack faces seven counts, including acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, obstruction of justice and making false statements. He is to be tried alongside his former assistant, Matthew Grimes, who was charged only on the lobbying counts. Both were arrested in July 2021; prosecutors filed a second indictment in the case in May with additional details about Mr. Barrack’s efforts.Lawyers for Mr. Grimes did not respond to a request for comment. In a February motion to dismiss the indictment, they said there was no allegation that he ever agreed to be an agent for the U.A.E.A third defendant, Rashid al-Malik, an Emirati businessman who left the United States in 2018 after federal agents interviewed him, remains at large, prosecutors said.Foreign governments have long sought favored status with U.S. presidential administrations. Wealthier nations, including the U.A.E., have tried to influence American politics and society through large donations to universities and think tanks, and through hiring armies of lobbyists to steer bills in Congress.But during the Trump administration, some Persian Gulf nations intensified efforts to gain access to the president and his top aides, many of whom had little foreign policy experience and were viewed as particularly susceptible to influence.How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.According to the indictment, in May 2016, Mr. Barrack — an Arabic speaker of Lebanese descent — agreed to serve as a back channel between the Emiratis and the Trump campaign. Soon after, Mr. Barrack sent Mr. al-Malik a copy of a speech that he said he had personally drafted for Mr. Trump, in which he praised Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Emirati ruler who was at the time the crown prince of Abu Dhabi.“They loved it so much! This is great,” Mr. al-Malik responded, according to the indictment, which quotes extensively from email and text messages.As the speech went through revisions, Mr. Barrack worked with campaign officials to ensure the remarks kept a positive reference to Persian Gulf allies, according to the indictment. After the speech, a senior Emirati official emailed Mr. Barrack to say “everybody here are very happy with the results.”During the Republican Party convention, Mr. Barrack worked with the Trump campaign to tailor parts of the platform with Emirati input, prosecutors said. He also praised the U.A.E. on television, according to the indictment; Mr. al-Malik pushed for the publicity and sent Mr. Barrack and Mr. Grimes talking points from a senior Emirati official.After Mr. Trump’s election, prosecutors said, Mr. Barrack communicated with senior Emirati officials about Mr. Trump’s transition and likely candidates for top posts. In December 2016, Mr. al-Malik gave Mr. Barrack a “wish list” of foreign policy moves, prosecutors said.Mr. al-Malik also encouraged Mr. Grimes to push the Trump administration to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization, a longtime goal of the Emiratis. “Yes,” Mr. Grimes responded. “At your direction.” Weeks later, Mr. Grimes sent Mr. al-Malik a news article suggesting that the move was being considered.Mr. Barrack has contended in court filings that his contacts with Gulf leaders were no secret. His communications, his lawyers wrote this year, would show that “his activities were undertaken with the knowledge of the Trump campaign and administration.”His lawyers have also noted that Mr. Barrack, while seeking an official position with the Trump administration, submitted extensive information to the government about overseas contacts. And, starting in late 2017, he voluntarily met with investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, during the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.The inquiry by the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn into Mr. Barrack’s ties with foreign leaders sprang from Mr. Mueller’s investigation.In 2019, Mr. Barrack learned he was being investigated by the F.B.I., although he has said he was not told he was the target, and arranged through his lawyers to meet agents. During that interview, prosecutors say, Mr. Barrack made false statements about his contacts with Mr. al-Malik and his role arranging contacts between the Trump administration and the U.A.E.In court papers, prosecutors have argued that Mr. Barrack stood to profit from his dealings, in part by soliciting U.A.E. money for his business ventures. According to the indictment, Mr. Barrack planned to pitch a proposed investment fund at a meeting with Sheikh bin Zayed, the Emirati ruler.There is no evidence that the proposed venture materialized or that Mr. Barrack met with the crown prince. But the indictment noted that in the following months, Emirati sovereign wealth funds invested a total of $374 million in two deals sponsored by the giant real estate company Mr. Barrack led, now known as DigitalBridge Group and formerly known as Colony Capital.Mr. Barrack is one of several associates of Mr. Trump to come under scrutiny for connections with foreign interests, in particular for lobbying U.S. officials on behalf of governments and other entities.In October 2020, Elliott Broidy, a former top fund-raiser, pleaded guilty to conspiring to influence the administration for Chinese and Malaysian interests. Mr. Broidy was pardoned by Mr. Trump in his final days in office.Michael T. Flynn, who briefly was Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, admitted in 2017 to working as a foreign agent for a Turkish businessman. The admission was part of a plea deal — Mr. Flynn was never charged in connection with Turkey — and in November 2020 Mr. Trump also pardoned him.Some dealings raised questions about ethics, not legality. After leaving the White House, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, secured a $2 billion investment from a Saudi Arabia investment fund, which some critics said created the appearance that Mr. Kushner was receiving payback for favorable White House actions.After Mr. Trump left office, his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, solicited funds for his own private equity fund, ultimately getting $1 billion from the Saudis and $500 million more from the Emiratis.David D.

	<title>Defending R. Kelly and Bill Cosby, the Same Combative Lawyer</title>
	<author>Julia Jacobs</author>
	<body>Jennifer Bonjean, a defense lawyer who has the words “not guilty” tattooed on her right arm, called one woman who accused R. Kelly of sexual abuse a “pathological liar.” She accused another of extortion. She tried to pick their accounts apart, and attacked prosecutors for stripping her client, the former R&amp;B star, of “every single bit of humanity that he has.”Ms. Bonjean, who was Mr. Kelly’s lead lawyer during the criminal trial in Chicago that ended with his conviction last week, has become known for her aggressive tactics in representing men accused of sexual misconduct in several of the highest profile cases of the #MeToo era.She helped Bill Cosby get his sexual assault conviction overturned last year, which led to his being freed from prison. She has also represented Keith Raniere, once the leader of the Nxivm sex cult, as he appealed his conviction on sex trafficking and other charges, for which he was sentenced to 120 years in prison.“Everyone’s entitled to a vigorous defense,” Ms. Bonjean, 52, said in an interview last week shortly before Mr. Kelly’s conviction on sex crimes involving minors was announced.Her theatrical, knock-down-drag-out style is hardly atypical in the world of criminal defense, but it has attracted attention at a time when #MeToo-era cases are reaching trial, as she has urged jurors to be skeptical of women who have testified, often through tears, about being sexually abused.“We are in an era of ‘believe women’ and I agree, but not in the courtroom,” Ms. Bonjean said during closing arguments in the Kelly case. “We don’t just believe women or believe anything. We scrutinize. There’s no place for mob-like thinking in a courtroom.”That perspective and her relentless cross-examination of accusers, which typically involves drilling them on any inconsistencies in their accounts and questioning their motives, has drawn criticism from those who say it could scare abused women from coming forward.Lili Bernard, who has sued Mr. Cosby and accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her in 1990, said she was upset by Ms. Bonjean’s behavior earlier this year where she defended Mr. Cosby in a civil case brought by a woman who said he had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager. Ms. Bernard, who attended the trial in California, called the lawyer’s cross-examination of that woman, Judy Huth, and other accusers “victim blaming and victim shaming.”Originally from Valparaiso, Ind., Ms. Bonjean (pronounced bon-JEEN) is a classically trained opera singer who earned a master’s degree in music and once worked at a rape crisis center in Chicago, advocating for victims of sexual violence — a stint, she said, that some might now see “as ironic.”That job led her to study at Loyola University Chicago’s law school with the intention of becoming a prosecutor, but she ended up going into defense work after gravitating toward “underdog” clients. As a lawyer who views prosecutorial overstep as her driving force, she gained prominence by focusing on so-called wrongful conviction cases.Russell Ainsworth, a staff attorney at the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School, has worked with Ms. Bonjean on civil rights cases for a decade and said that typically, he plays the “straight guy,” while she “comes out swinging.”“If I needed a lawyer to go to the mat for me, that’s the lawyer I would choose,” he said.Her approach was on display earlier this year in the civil suit brought by Ms. Huth, who accused Mr. Cosby of sexually assaulting her at the Playboy Mansion in 1975, when she was 16.During Ms. Bonjean’s cross-examination of Ms. Huth, she challenged her on why it had taken her decades to come forward with her accusation. At one point she suggested that Ms. Huth had kept quiet about the trip to the mansion, not because she had buried painful memories, but because she was uncomfortable telling people that she had gone there with Mr. Cosby because he is Black. Ms. Huth strongly denied that.During the trial, Ms. Bonjean turned her attention to Ms. Bernard, and accused her in court of speaking with a juror during a break. She argued for a mistrial. (The judge denied Ms. Bonjean’s request.)“In that little moment that she tried to falsely accuse me, I felt the wrath of her, the depths she would go to,” Ms. Bernard said in an interview.Ms. Bonjean, whose firm is based in New York, said that she considers herself a feminist, insisting that the label is not inconsistent with her work as a defense lawyer for accused men. Her responsibility, she explained, is to exercise every legal lever at her disposal for her client, noting, “that will not always be consistent with sensitivity to a victim’s feelings.”And she contends that if she were a male lawyer, people wouldn’t think twice about her approach, simply chalking it up to a lawyer doing his job.“I’m supposed to be some type of ambassador — a vagina ambassador,” she said, “Seriously, I get a lot of those questions, like somehow I am traitorous to women by taking on these cases.”During Mr. Kelly’s Chicago case, Ms. Bonjean was boldly combative at every turn. She fought to keep as much of the video footage away from the jury as possible, maintained a steady stream of objections and sometimes kept the fight for her client going on Twitter.At one point, prosecutors complained to the judge about a tweet she posted in which she accused them of playing dirty tricks. Ms. Bonjean offered to refrain from tweeting about the court proceedings, she said, and the judge agreed. A few days later, Ms. Bonjean posted: “I’m not allowed to tweet but I think I can retweet,” sharing someone else’s tweet that quoted her from the trial, calling one of the government’s key witnesses “a liar, a thief and an extortionist.”“I had to find what worked for me,” Ms. Bonjean said of her approach. “My aggressive style — some people call it fiery, some people call it, whatever words you want to use to describe it, that was the way that I could be effective.”Debra S. Katz, a lawyer who has represented high-profile sexual misconduct accusers, said that defense tactics seeking to shred a woman’s credibility or impugn her character run the risk of failing with a jury, citing Harvey Weinstein’s conviction in New York, during which she represented one of the women accusing the producer of sexual assault.“Everybody deserves a defense, but to attack women in this way is, in my view, absolutely unconscionable,” Ms. Katz said.Ms. Bonjean’s highest profile success has been her role in appealing Mr. Cosby’s sexual assault conviction. She and her co-counsels persuaded the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that prosecutors violated Mr. Cosby’s rights by reneging on an apparent promise not to charge him on allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand in 2004.Mr. Cosby’s more recent civil trial ended with a jury finding against him that awarded Ms. Huth $500,000 in damages.In Mr. Kelly’s recent case, he was found guilty of some of the most serious charges, including of coercing minors into sexual activity and producing child sexual abuse videos. He was acquitted on several other charges, including that he had sought to obstruct an earlier investigation.In both cases, Ms. Bonjean has pledged to mount a vigorous appeal.Robert Chiarito contributed reporting from Chicago.</body>

	<title>Thousands Pay Tribute as Britain Says Final Farewell to Its Queen</title>
	<author>Mark Landler</author>
	<body>LONDON — Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest on Monday after a majestic state funeral that drew tens of millions of Britons together in a vast expression of grief and gratitude, as they bade farewell to a sovereign whose seven-decade reign had spanned their lives and defined their times.It was the culmination of 10 days of mourning since the queen died on Sept. 8 in Scotland — a highly choreographed series of rituals that fell amid a deepening economic crisis and a fraught political transition in Britain — and yet everything about the day seemed destined to be etched into history.Tens of thousands of people lined the route of the cortege past the landmarks of London. In Hyde Park, people watching the service on large screens joined in “The Lord’s Prayer” when it was recited at Westminster Abbey. Thousands more cheered, many strewing flowers in the path of her glass-topped hearse, as the queen’s coffin was driven to Windsor Castle, where she was buried next to her husband, Prince Philip.“In this changing world, she was a pillar of the old world,” said Richard Roe, 36, who works in finance in Zurich and flew home for the funeral. “It’s nice to have something that’s stable and stands for good values.”An unbroken thread of sadness ran through the day, but also an acute sense of uncertainty. The queen, who died at 96, was one of the last living links to World War II and the twilight of Britain’s imperial age. The country she embodied with such dignity has fundamentally changed.A new Britain is taking shape among the diverse crowds that turned out with their iPhones and Instagram accounts to document the funeral. But its contours, and the role of the monarchy, are still up for grabs, as people struggle with less regal concerns like rising gas and electricity bills, and a looming recession.On Tuesday, Britain will return to wrestling with the gravest economic crisis in a generation. Fears about its public finances have driven the pound to its lowest levels against the dollar since 1985. The survival of the monarchy’s far-flung realm is in question, as Caribbean countries debate whether to cast off the king as their head of state.Britain’s uncertain future, however, was a matter for another day, as it paid tribute to one of the great symbols of its past. More than 100 world leaders, including President Biden and Emperor Naruhito of Japan, converged on London, the largest such gathering since the funeral of Nelson Mandela in 2013 in South Africa.Years in the planning, the tribute to the queen was both intimate and grand: from the gun carriage that carried her flag-draped coffin through the streets of London to a lone bagpiper playing his lament, its haunting strains carried aloft in the hushed nave of Westminster Abbey.“The pattern of many leaders is to be exalted in life and forgotten after death,” the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said in a eulogy that seemed to speak to a world plagued by misrule. Not so of Elizabeth, of whom he said: “Few leaders receive the outpouring of love that we have seen.”To judge by the tear-streaked faces, and the cries of “God bless the queen,” in the streets and parks, his words were not an overstatement.Becoming queen. Following the death of King George VI, Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary ascended to the throne on Feb. 6, 1952, at age 25. The coronation of the newly minted Queen Elizabeth II took place on June 2 the following year.A historic visit. On May 18, 1965, Elizabeth arrived in Bonn on the first state visit by a British monarch to Germany in more than 50 years. The trip formally sealed the reconciliation between the two nations following the world wars.First grandchild. In 1977, the queen stepped into the role of grandmother for the first time, after Princess Anne gave birth to a son, Peter. Elizabeth’s four children have given her a total of eight grandchildren, who have been followed by several great-grandchildren.Princess Diana’s death. In a rare televised broadcast ahead of Diana’s funeral in 1997, Queen Elizabeth remembered the Princess of Wales, who died in a car crash in Paris at age 36, as “an exceptional and gifted human being.”Golden jubilee. In 2002, celebrations to mark Elizabeth II's 50 years as queen culminated in a star-studded concert at Buckingham Palace in the presence of 12,000 cheering guests, with an estimated one million more watching on giant screens set up around London.A trip to Ireland. In May 2011, the queen visited the Irish Republic, whose troubled relationship with the British monarchy spanned centuries. The trip, infused with powerful symbols of reconciliation, is considered one of the most politically freighted trips of Elizabeth’s reign.Breaking a record. As of 5:30 p.m. British time on Sept. 9, 2015, Elizabeth II became Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, surpassing Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandmother. Elizabeth was 89 at the time, and had ruled for 23,226 days, 16 hours and about 30 minutes.Marking 70 years of marriage. On Nov. 20, 2017, the queen and Prince Philip celebrated their 70th anniversary, becoming the longest-married couple in royal history. The two wed in 1947, as the country and the world was still reeling from the atrocities of World War II.Losing her spouse. In 2021, Queen Elizabeth II bade farewell to Prince Philip, who died on April 9. An image of the queen grieving alone at the funeral amid coronavirus restrictions struck a chord with viewers at home following the event.“She is everything that I am proud to be British about,” said Bea McArthur, 38, a hospital worker who traveled from Hampshire, England, on Friday, camping out with her two daughters and a friend to secure a spot in the front row of the parade route.“She made a promise when she was 21, and she did not falter,” Ms. McArthur said. “When she first became queen, there weren’t many women in powerful roles, and she blew everyone else out of the water.”Mr. Roe, the Zurich businessman, was more upbeat. “I think people have dealt with the grief side of it now,” he said. “This is more of a last goodbye, a celebration.”The service was also designed to showcase Britain’s imperial history, its constitutional democracy and its Commonwealth. The carriage used for the queen’s coffin was first used for that purpose in Queen Victoria’s funeral in 1901. The new prime minister, Liz Truss, read from the Gospel of John, while the secretary general of the Commonwealth, Patricia Scotland, read from Corinthians (“O death, where is thy sting?”).Archbishop Welby described the queen as a beacon of hope. He recalled a speech she gave during the coronavirus pandemic, when she promised Britons enduring isolating lockdowns, “We will meet again,” the refrain of a cherished World War II-era song by Vera Lynn.“All who follow the queen’s example, and inspiration of trust and faith in God,” he declared, “can with her say, ‘We will meet again.’”Britain has not held a state funeral since 1965, when it buried Winston Churchill, the wartime leader who acted as a mentor to a young Elizabeth after she unexpectedly came to the throne on the death of her father, King George VI, in 1952.There were echoes of that history as the queen’s cortege rolled past statues of Churchill and George VI. But there were also glimpses of the royal family’s future. Prince George, 9, who is the elder son of Prince William and second in line to the throne, stood in the front row at the abbey, along with his 7-year-old sister, Princess Charlotte. Both sang dutifully from their hymnals.The new king, Charles III, was a quiet presence on a day devoted to his mother. On her coffin, next to a wreath of roses, hydrangea and dahlias — all arranged, by order of the king, without the use of floral foam to make it more sustainable — he had left a handwritten note, “In loving and devoted memory, Charles R.”He marched behind the coffin as it was conveyed to Westminster Abbey from Westminster Hall, where she had lain in state for four days, viewed by tens of thousands of people, including dignitaries like Mr. Biden and ordinary people who lined up in what became known as “The Queue,” waiting up to 24 hours to pay their respects.He marched behind it on its procession up Whitehall, down The Mall and past Buckingham Palace, before reaching Wellington Arch, where an honor guard transferred the coffin to the hearse. And he saluted as a military band played a wistful last rendition of “God Save the Queen” when she departed.The procession, a mile and a quarter long, projected the full splendor of the monarchy: seven groups, each with its own marching band; detachments from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British armed forces; and mounted soldiers from the Household Cavalry.Charles, wearing a Royal Navy tailcoat and carrying a sword, was joined by members of the royal family, their turbulent recent history traced in their choice of dress. Prince Andrew, who served in the Royal Navy during the Falklands War, wore a morning suit rather than a uniform, reflecting his banishment from royal duties because of his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sexual predator.Prince Harry also wore a suit because of his withdrawal from royal duties when he moved to the United States in 2020 with his American-born wife, Meghan. He had received the king’s permission to wear a uniform to stand vigil over the queen’s coffin on Saturday, but it did not have her monogram, E.R., on its shoulders, denoting his diminished status.The royal family, Archbishop Welby said, was grieving as any family would, but in this case, it had to do it “in the brightest spotlight.”The spotlight still shone bright, but the setting was more intimate after the queen’s coffin arrived at Windsor, the turreted castle where she had spent most of her final days, sequestered during the pandemic. In April 2021, she buried Philip, her husband of 73 years, in an austere funeral at St. George’s Chapel there that was memorable for images of the queen, isolated and masked in a choir stall.As her hearse rolled up the Long Walk, the tree-lined boulevard that leads to the castle, it was cheered by more crowds and flanked by a detachment of the queen’s Grenadier Guards and Household Cavalry.But as the cortege drew closer to the castle, these symbols of royalty  gave way to more personal reminders of the queen’s life there: her Fell pony, Emma, ears and tail twitching as she watched the cortege pass; and two of her corgis, Muick and Sandy, waiting patiently by the door.If anything, the ceremony at Windsor, known as the committal, was even more laden with ritual than the funeral. Before the final hymn, the crown jeweler removed the imperial state crown, the orb and the scepter — precious regalia symbolizing the crown — from the coffin and placed them on the altar.As a totem of the end of his service, the queen’s lord chamberlain, the most senior officer in the royal household, broke his wand of office into two pieces and placed them on to the coffin, to be buried with his sovereign.The coffin was then lowered into the royal vault, where the queen was interred next to Philip in a private family ceremony later in the evening. Once again, the queen’s piper played a mournful lament, its sound dying out as he walked slowly away from the chapel.In a last reminder of the monarchy’s continuity, the congregation sang, “God save the King.” Charles, his face bearing the weight of grief and, perhaps, the burdens of his new job, looked on wordlessly.Saskia Solomon and Emma Bubola contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>In the eastern Donbas, a slew of contradictions. </title>
	<author>Jeffrey Gettleman</author>
	<body>CHASIV YAR, Ukraine — On a clear spring morning eight years ago, Oleksandr Khainus stepped outside his house to go to work at the town factory when he spotted new graffiti scrawled across his fence. “Glory to Russia,” vandals had written in angry black spray paint. “Putin,” another message said.Mr. Khainus was perplexed. It was true that Chasiv Yar, the Rust Belt-like town where he has spent his entire life in a region called the Donbas, had long contained many conflicting opinions on its identity. Geographically, the Donbas was part of Ukraine, no question, but it was so close to Russia and so tied to it historically that many maintained that their true home really lay eastward.“It was the type of stuff you’d argue about over the dinner table,” he said. “But nothing that anyone would get violent over.”Mr. Khainus’s optimism now seems almost quaint.In the next few months in 2014, pro-Russia protests exploded. Armed separatists seized some parts of the Donbas, including Chasiv Yar right under the authorities’ noses. Two so-called People’s Republics were declared. Russian troops stormed in.Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s leader, turned this patch of Eastern Europe into a personal project, sowing the seeds for an explosion of bloodshed that would spawn the most far-reaching war in generations. It was the Donbas that became Mr. Putin’s pretext for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And now it is heating up again.The Ukrainians have just pulled off a masterful offensive in the Kharkiv region, in Ukraine’s northeast, where town after town fell without a shot. Now they are heading south. Columns of dark green military trucks and American-made rocket launchers are thundering down the long, straight highways into the Donbas. But they will have a much harder fight on their hands.To understand the Donbas, and how it became the benighted chunk of territory that Mr. Putin wants so badly, is to see it as an integral piece of a grand strategy to resurrect elements of the Soviet world. Some people living here welcome that; others cannot imagine anything worse.The region is full of contradictions like these, both rustic and industrial, beautiful and blood-soaked, enormously important to the national economy but in terminal decline. For the past eight years, Mr. Putin has thoroughly destabilized this complicated corner of Ukraine.Then, on Feb. 24, 2022, he turned its problems into a global crisis.</body>

	<title>Alain Tanner, Leading Director in Swiss New Wave, Dies at 92</title>
	<author>Alex Williams</author>
	<body>Alain Tanner, a pioneering director in the Swiss New Wave movement that took off in the 1970s, known for his cerebral, left-leaning films that challenged bourgeois complacency, died on Sept. 11 in Geneva. He was 92.His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by the Association Alain Tanner, a Geneva-based group that preserves and promotes his work.Growing up in Switzerland, surrounded by France, Germany, and Italy with their rich cinema traditions, Mr. Tanner went on to be a founder of the so-called Group of 5, norm-shattering Swiss directors who helped drive a new form of national cinema. His best-known films tended toward a stark neorealism, laced with incisive dialogue and an arid wit, and often centered on characters struggling against conformity.Looking back on his career in his later years, Mr. Tanner said he was proud to have been part of a generation that strove to shake the social order.“During the second half of the last century,” he said, “I lived through what was probably the most engaging for cinema, with the questioning of the old styles, the break with old structures and the arrival of modernity.”A sharp-eyed observer of discontent, both emotional and social, he never achieved the name recognition of the French New Wave masters like François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, who died on Tuesday at 91. He acknowledged both as influences.Regardless, critics considered him an important voice. In a 1990 review of Mr. Tanner’s film “A Flame in My Heart,” Vincent Canby described him in The New York Times as a “first-class director” and “one of the most securely cerebral of European filmmakers.”“The Salamander” (1971), which Mr. Tanner shot in 16-millimeter, established his reputation worldwide and had a yearlong run at the Cinéma Saint-André des Arts in Paris. “Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000” (1976) was an art-house hit in Europe and the United States.Mr. Tanner, a native of French-speaking Geneva, made his early films in French, but his first English-language film, “Light Years Away,” which starred Trevor Howard as a junkyard-dwelling spiritual guide to a rebellious young drifter, won the jury’s special grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1981.By that point Mr. Tanner’s reputation in film circles was already cemented based on his groundbreaking films that grappled with the spirit of revolution and personal reinvention of the 1960s.His first feature film, “Charles, Dead or Alive” (1969), conceived in the wake of the 1968 student protests that swept Europe, involved a prosperous middle-aged Swiss watchmaker who abandons a thriving family business, adopts an assumed name and embarks on an ill-fated journey of self-discovery as he settles into a life on the fringes of society with a young couple.Mr. Tanner’s best known films of the 1970s, written with the English novelist, critic and Marxist theorist John Berger, concern the legacies of the tumultuous ’60s.“The Middle of the World” (1974), explores a love affair between an Italian waitress at a railroad cafe and a married engineer who is running for the Swiss Parliament, but also the class tensions between them.“Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000” (1976), focuses on a group of disillusioned friends in Geneva — including an activist-turned-proofreader, an itinerant history professor and a trade unionist — who are prone to extemporizing on topics as diverse as capitalism, revolution, train travel and sex.“Each of the characters is, in his or her own way, as surrounded as Switzerland, hemmed in,” Mr. Canby wrote in The Times in 1976. But, he added, “they have not been anesthetized by mediocrity into dreamless boredom.”Alain Tanner was born on Dec. 6, 1929, in Geneva. His father was a publicist, writer and poet; his mother was a painter.Growing up in Romandy, the French-speaking region in western Switzerland, Mr. Tanner felt alienated from the country’s German-speaking majority. “Switzerland exists much more for the German Swiss than for us,” he was quoted as saying in a 1976 interview with the film critic James Monaco. “They have a real identity, while we don’t.”A lover of movies since childhood, he experienced an epiphany as a teenager when he discovered Italian neorealist directors like Vittorio De Sica and Roberto Rossellini. At the University of Geneva, Mr. Tanner studied economics, but his real passion was for film. He started a campus film club with Claude Goretta, who would help found the Group of 5. Seeking adventure beyond his native country, he joined the merchant navy after graduation.In the mid-1950s, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Goretta settled in London, where they found work curating archives and subtitling films for the British Film Institute. They befriended the young directors Lindsay Anderson and Karel Reisz, who were involved with a budding school of documentary filmmaking called Free Cinema. In 1957, Mr. Tanner and Mr. Goretta joined the movement with “Nice Time,” a 17-minute documentary rumination about Piccadilly Circus at night. It won the prize for experimental film at the Venice Film Festival.Returning to Switzerland a few years later, Mr. Tanner directed for television before forming the Group of 5 in 1968; besides Mr. Goretta, the others were Michel Soutter, Jean-Louis Roy and Jean-Jacques Lagrange. His first feature, “Charles Dead or Alive,” won the top prize at the Locarno Film Festival. Mr. Tanner is survived by his wife, Janine; two daughters, Nathalie and Cécile; and three grandchildren.By the end of his career he had made 21 feature films, including the erotic psychological dramas “A Flame in My Heart” (1987) and “The Diary of Lady M” (1993), along with numerous documentaries for Swiss television.A director once invigorated by the spirit of revolution had long ago mellowed in his political passions.“I believe that neither capitalism nor Communism does anybody any good,” Mr. Tanner said in a 1976 Times interview. “I’m not so much politically minded; I think more about the individual and peoples’ lives.”</body>

	<title>Warnings Signs Multiply Ahead of Pivotal Fed Meeting</title>
	<author>Ephrat Livni</author>
	<body>It’s rates week. The Fed will join the central banks of England, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland in determining whether to raise interest rates further in an effort to blunt rising inflation. More and more economists and investors are worried that the global economy could be hobbled by the continuous tightening of monetary policy.All eyes will be on the Fed this Wednesday. The consensus estimate is for a 75-basis-point increase, bringing the benchmark interest rate to between 3 and 3.25 percent — up from near zero at the start of the year. Higher interest rates generally slow lending and economic activity, and with it the forces that push prices higher. So far, it’s not going to plan. Last week, the government reported that consumer prices rose 8.3 percent in the past year, through the end of August. The Fed’s rate increases are having the most direct impact on housing. Mortgage rates climbed above 6 percent last week for the first time since 2008. Rising borrowing costs have slowed home buying significantly, though the effect on home values has been more muted. Prices appear to still be rising in most parts of the country, though much slower than they once were.Stock investors are feeling the pressure, too. The S&amp;P 500 fell 5 percent last week, one of the market’s worst weeks of the year.  Pessimistic growth forecasts are also spooking investors. Shipping giant FedEx on Friday warned of a slowdown in its business, particularly in Asia and Europe. Executives at G.E. and JPMorgan Chase have also delivered gloomy outlooks.Some warn that raising rates could do more harm than good. The billionaire real estate developer Barry Sternlicht said last week that unless the Fed paused rate increases, the economy could fall into a significant recession. “The economy is braking hard,” Sternlicht told CNBC. In a note to clients on Friday, Bank of America economists predicted that Fed policymakers would be likely to revise their economic projections this week to include less growth and higher unemployment. Corporations, too, are in trouble. “An earnings shock is likely coming,” Candace Browning, Bank of America’s head of global research, wrote in a separate note.“The pandemic is over,” President Biden says. The off-the-cuff declaration, made in an interview with “60 Minutes,” was meant to reflect the progress the U.S. has made in combating the coronavirus. But experts have warned that hundreds of Americans are still dying from Covid every day, and that much work remains.BlackRock’s C.E.O. offers to help Ukraine’s economy. Larry Fink met via videoconference with President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss how his money management giant could help create an economic reconstruction fund for Ukraine. An important task for Ukraine “is to achieve victories in the economy as well, and to be an attractive country for investors,” Zelensky said.Donald Trump’s former accountants turn over evidence to Congress. Mazars USA, which cut ties with the former president and his family business this year, has begun handing over Trump’s records to House investigators. Lawmakers have been examining potential conflicts of interest, inadequate disclosures and violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution.Hurricane Fiona batters Puerto Rico. The U.S. territory lost power yesterday, leaving 1.5 million customers without electricity in what its governor called “catastrophic” damage. The storm has since hit the Dominican Republic and is expected to strengthen to a Category 3 as it speeds through the Caribbean.Britain says farewell to Queen Elizabeth II. The state funeral for the late monarch began this morning, with President Biden and other world leaders in attendance. Businesses in Britain were largely closed, a broad economic pause that economists say could help to tip the nation into recession, at least technically.We’re a competitive bunch here, but today we doff our hats to our friends at Axios. After selling their company to Cox Enterprises for $525 million, the media publisher’s co-founders — Jim VandeHei, Mike Allen and Roy Schwartz — have a new book out tomorrow, “Smart Brevity,” that offers smart and, well, Axios-y ways to communicate in a short-attention-span world. (Staff members at JPMorgan Chase once asked Axios to trim Jamie Dimon’s 32,000-word annual letter. They cut it to 1,580 words.)VandeHei, a former reporter at The Washington Post and a co-founder of Politico, has plenty of thoughts on the media environment as well. Here’s what he told us.A toll on borrowers. The Federal Reserve has been raising the federal funds rate, its key interest rate, as it tries to rein in inflation. By raising the rate, which is what banks charge one another for overnight loans, the Fed sets off a ripple effect. Whether directly or indirectly, a number of borrowing costs for consumers go up.Consumer loans. Changes in credit card rates will closely track the Fed’s moves, so consumers can expect to pay more on any revolving debt. Car loan rates are expected to rise, too. Private student loan borrowers should also expect to pay more.Mortgages. Mortgage rates don’t move in lock step with the federal funds rate, but track the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, which is influenced by inflation and how investors expect the Fed to react to rising prices. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have climbed above 6 percent for the first time since 2008, according to Freddie Mac.Banks. An increase in the Fed benchmark rate often means banks will pay more interest on deposits. Larger banks are less likely to pay consumers more, and online banks have already started raising some of their rates.How Axios got sold to Cox: Though news reports correctly noted that Axios had held deal talks with both the German media conglomerate Axel Springer and The Athletic, VandeHei said that neither was the right match. “We’re kind of a weird company to buy,” he deadpanned.Of The Athletic, he said, “They were fun discussions, but we were not an obvious fit.” The New York Times Company ended up buying The Athletic for $550 million.Of Axel Springer, VandeHei said it was a difference in world views. Springer favored having “a constellation of brands,” while Axios wanted to be the star of the show. Moreover, VandeHei and his team wanted to have control of their own destiny, something they worried wasn’t possible there. Springer eventually bought Politico for over $1 billion.Enter Cox, the cable and media company that first invested in Axios last year. Cox encouraged Axios to grow, and eventually offered to buy the company outright to help it expand, especially in local news. VandeHei’s reporting on Cox persuaded him to trust his suitor. “We never took the deal out for a bidding war,” he said. “We told them exactly what it would take, and they delivered it almost verbatim.”Why the future of (some) media companies is bright: VandeHei said Axios would keep expanding all of its offerings, including subscriptions-based products for professionals, a local news offering that he hopes will eventually cover over 100 U.S. cities, and Axios HQ, the software affiliate that helps Axios-ify corporate communications.But while many news publishers are struggling, VandeHei notes that older (including The Times and The Wall Street Journal) and newer media companies (like The Information, Punchbowl and the upcoming Semafor) are poised to do well by marrying good journalism with things readers want. “If you can build a relationship with an audience and be sane with business economics, you can succeed,” he said.The Justice Department just turned 150 federal prosecutors nationwide into crypto cops. This network — announced Friday along with a report mandated by an executive order from President Biden in March — includes fraud, tax, environment and other specialists, along with the obvious tech types, said the director of crypto enforcement, Eun Young Choi. “One thing that really stood out to us about digital asset crime is that, unlike other cases, these are really multidisciplinary and international,” she told DealBook.The Darknet and other gray areas are in focus. Illegal markets for drugs, child sexual abuse material, firearms, fake and stolen information, and hacking are “a significant focus” of the department’s efforts. Crypto use has grown to billions annually on the Darknet, Choi says. And new unregulated markets, like decentralized finance, or DeFi, platforms, have popped up in more accessible areas of the internet that also pose investor risks and consumer protection issues.“DeFi is an area of particular concern,” Choi said. Potentially complicating the department’s efforts is the fact that DeFi is still loosely defined, particularly as it pertains to what makes these platforms or products decentralized. DeFi champions often say that code, and not humans, are in control of these platforms, and therefore developers should be mostly out of police reach. Choi disagrees. “Code is like any other tool. There is a person behind it.”The issue has sparked a feud among crypto insiders. “Decentralization is a spectrum, and where the line is drawn between centralized and decentralized is a policy choice that Congress will eventually have to make,” said Miller Whitehouse-Levine of the DeFi Education Fund lobbying association.The department’s approach will be global in scope. “These are fast-moving, complicated, challenging situations” and they cross continents, Choi said. “It’s a lot of coordinating and early info-sharing.”Crypto experts in and out of government gave the department mixed reviews on this front, with some lauding its engagement with other agencies and others telling DealBook that the report fails to address gaps in international coordination.— Joel Lalgee, a recruiter who has racked up followers and engagement on the social network by delving into un-LinkedIn-like personal sharing.Volkswagen announced last night that it planned to sell shares in the luxury sports-car brand Porsche at a valuation of up to $75 billion. The news marks one of the last steps in setting up one of the biggest I.P.O.s in years, at a time when the market for taking companies public is particularly challenged.The pricing details: VW aims to sell preferred shares in Porsche at between 76.50 and 82.50 euros ($76.29 to $82.27). The Porsche and Piech families, VW’s biggest shareholders, have agreed to buy 25 percent of the offering at a 7.5 percent premium to the I.P.O. price, while three sovereign wealth funds and T. Rowe Price, will also buy significant stakes.Volkswagen expects to use proceeds from the offering for a special dividend and investment in electric-vehicle technology.Porsche’s offering would break a drought of big-ticket I.P.O.s, as volatile stock markets have cooled interest in new offerings. At its expected valuation, the deal would be Europe’s third-biggest debut, defying negative news — like the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and a spiraling energy crisis — that have weighed on stock markets and Europe’s in particular.Porsche is expected to begin trading on Sept. 29.DealsSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, urged federal regulators to block JetBlue’s $3.8 billion takeover of Spirit.

	<title>An Italian Villa Where Architecture Is a Family Affair</title>
	<author>Max Norman</author>
	<body>WHEN ALDO BUSINARO acquired Il Palazzetto in 1964, the proud Palladian-style villa outside Monselice, an ancient town a 30-minute drive south of Padua in northeast Italy, was all but unlivable. Purchased by Businaro’s grandfather in 1924, when it was already near derelict, the house was used for agricultural storage, its only residents farm tools, surplus grain and dormice for decades, except for a brief stint during World War II. Still, determined to transform it into a family home, Businaro uprooted his wife, Lucia, and their three sons from Padua, and moved in the following year. Federico, the middle child, now 58, remembers that initially they slept all together in the one room whose ceiling didn’t leak; Lucia cooked their meals on a camping stove. Built in 1627 for Francesco Giovanni Tassello, a prosperous doctor, Il Palazzetto stands at the center of a 50-acre estate of fertile farmland. An 8,600-square-foot cube with a red clay-tile roof and ivy-covered tan plaster facade, the house is a so-called minor villa, yet Tassello clearly had major ambitions: Above the trompe l’oeil columns and doorways that decorate the 20-foot-high walls of the salon on the second floor, a ribbon of frescoes depict scenes from Virgil’s “Aeneid.” But Tassello became ill with bubonic plague before he could finish the sweeping entrance he’d almost certainly planned for the house, which meant the villa the Businaros inherited was in disrepair and incomplete.A sales consultant to furniture manufacturers such as Bernini, Knoll and Cassina, Businaro wanted not just to restore the three-story villa but to make it a family seat worthy of his profile as a promoter of contemporary Italian design. In the late ’60s, the prodigious architect and furniture designer Tobia Scarpa, whom Businaro knew professionally, helped with the earliest significant improvements, converting a former storeroom into a dark, minimalist kitchen and building a simple iron-rimmed stucco fireplace in the dining room and a dramatic chimney, covered in off-white plaster, for the hearth in Businaro’s first-floor study — the room in which the entire family had once slept. Around the same time, the British architect Colin Glennie, another friend of Businaro’s, transformed part of the third floor into a spare living area with a pair of adjoining bedrooms. But it wasn’t until Businaro met Tobia’s father, the renowned architect Carlo Scarpa, on a work trip to Japan in 1969 that he found a collaborator who would respond to, rather than rewrite, the villa’s 17th-century vernacular. Their lasting friendship was one of the few constants in the last decade of the elder Scarpa’s life — and forever altered the spirit of Businaro’s home. Over a period of nearly 40 years, the villa’s remaking would weave together the lives of not just two generations of the Businaro family but also two generations of Scarpas.AT A BUSINARO family lunch last summer, sitting in the dining room beneath one of his cloudlike ruffled-linen Celestia ceiling lamps, Tobia Scarpa dismissed his contributions to Il Palazzetto as inconsequential. “Because I’m a lefty,” he said, “I design with both hands: serious things with the right, and things that don’t matter with the left.” For him, the kitchen and fireplaces were left-hand projects: jobs for a powerful friend that he dashed off in moments when he wasn’t working with his collaborator and then-wife, Afra, who died in 2011, on the rigorously functional yet elegant furniture and lamps that had already made the pair famous. He didn’t need the work and was wary of getting between his father and a project. Even now, at 86, Tobia has a complex relationship with his father, defined by both deep admiration and unresolved resentments. Once Businaro met Scarpa, Tobia said matter-of-factly, “they sent me away.” Or rather, he clarified, “I went away.” He wouldn’t use his right hand at Il Palazzetto for another four decades.There was no real plan when Businaro invited Scarpa to start working at Il Palazzetto in 1970. “At the time, he was a bit of a prophet in his own land,” Federico said. The architect was respected by Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Kahn in the United States, but his unmistakable aesthetic, which combined concrete and marble volumes with carefully wrought details in wood and brass, was less well received in Italy. “So whenever my father knew that the Professore” — as Businaro called Scarpa — “didn’t have work, he would say, ‘Professore, come and make me something.’” Still, the villa had certain needs: Its main entryway, an arched rusted iron gate, wanted reimagining; it lacked facilities for alfresco entertaining; and its second-floor entrance was a door to nowhere, opening not onto a grand stairway as must once have been intended but, anticlimactically, onto a diminutive Juliet balcony — which helped guide Scarpa’s work. Beyond that, Businaro was happy for his friend to let his imagination run free. Scarpa would stay for days at a time in the villa’s attic apartment, where he worked at a small desk, perched at the highest point of the house.Scarpa’s practice was informed by both his resistance to the postwar craze for mass production and his deep devotion to the near-extinct artisanal craftsmanship of his native Veneto region, and many of his projects were renovations, architectural pas de deux. But unlike his public or other residential works, his revision of Il Palazzetto drew on rural, rather than urban, traditions of Veneto. The property was a working farm until the turn of the millennium, and Scarpa’s interventions were made mostly to the exterior, to control the approach to the villa through the lightly wooded 2 1/2-acre park that surrounds it. He began by constructing a 7 1/2-foot-high wall around the park, made from rugged gray volcanic trachyte mined from the nearby hills. Set within this, a 13-by-8-foot rectangular hinged gate — whose weathered larch planks, fixed with traditional nails, form interlocking rectangles that together resemble an ancient Greek meander — opens to reveal a view of the villa perfectly framed between the property’s 19th-century hay barn, which Tobia had faced with wood, to the north and 16th-century porticoed stone stable to the west.Occupying the courtyard formed by these three buildings is one of Scarpa’s most subtly distinctive projects at the house: a reinterpretation of the home’s original paved threshing floor, or aia, the heart of the Italian farm. Realized in 1974, this otherworldly sandblasted terra-cotta brick and concrete landscape reimagines a traditional, gently sloping pyramidal aia with two peaks, each topped with a flat disk — Scarpa called one the sun and the other the moon — made of soft Vicenza stone; through its center, the architect laid a concrete path to the home’s ground-floor entrance. Though the work is now effectively a sculpture, Federico remembers that, when the family still farmed, it was often used as a place to pile smaller produce, like beans, at harvest time.Adjoining the perimeter wall to the east of the house, Scarpa designed an outdoor dining room, built in 1972, to provide a place for entertaining in the warmer months. Closed in on two sides by concrete walls and covered only by a grid of slender concrete beams, it feels at once substantial and ethereal. A towering elevator-size rectangular chimney crafted from the same trachyte as the park wall looms above an enormous grill, forming a third enclosing plane, its concrete face inscribed with a geometric abstraction reminiscent of a volcano, complete with a line of colored tiles, made by the famed Orsoni workshop in Venice, which climb up the surface like smoke. Scarpa’s work on the villa itself, and on the barn — where Federico now lives with his wife, Natalia — is more subdued, operating unostentatiously within the rural idiom. Nonetheless, his signature is everywhere, from the oversize Venetian chimney that crowns the southwest corner of the roof to the bricks in the pavement in front of the barn, whose four perforations, originally made for the convenience of the bricklayers, he had filled with a white mixture of cement, lime and marble dust to create a polka-dot effect: Like all his work at Il Palazzetto, the unexpected touch gives new life to an ancient, rustic form.IN 1978, BUSINARO and Scarpa returned to Japan as part of a cultural delegation but, while there, the architect was fatally injured in an accident in Sendai. The last drawing he filed before leaving Italy was a plan for a monumental concrete staircase that would run parallel to the front of Il Palazzetto, a design he had been trying to perfect for years. And though, over the decades that followed, the Businaros accumulated a rich collection of furniture and sculpture by Scarpa and other Modernist masters, including Tobia, it wasn’t until 2000 that Ferdinando, now 56, the youngest of Businaro’s children, felt able to help his father realize Scarpa’s final contribution to the house. One of Businaro’s conditions for tackling the project, however, was that Tobia oversee it. But Tobia refused: He had a policy of not setting a hand on his father’s work. Still, the Businaros kept calling until, after five years, Tobia agreed to visit Il Palazzetto for the first time in decades. He eventually accepted the job when he learned that it would be the three brothers’ parting gift to their ailing father.Businaro did not live to see the stairway — it was completed in late 2006, just months after his death — but he would likely have been impressed by the grace with which it unifies the courtyard. A long wing of concrete spans the distance between the barn and the villa, presenting a view of the park beyond. Ten 6 1/2-foot-wide steps, cantilevered from a concrete wall behind, float up from the aia toward a landing, from which another six bring you to the doorway and a balcony, now covered with thick climbing ivy, that hovers above a shallow wedge-shaped pool edged with the same colorful Venetian tiles used in the outdoor dining room. Tobia studied his father’s designs for six months before he broke ground and, for the most part, made only minor changes. He did, however, solve one of the central problems of Scarpa’s Modernist constructions: the instability of their concrete, whose iron rebar tends to swell with humidity, fracturing even seemingly indestructible volumes. At Il Palazzetto, Tobia had the concrete cast over custom-made stainless-steel rebar, ensuring that the structure stays intact for generations to come.I asked Tobia if working on the staircase changed the way he thought about his father. “There was a bad son and a bad father,” he said. “And the two never agreed to become a good father and a good son.” Tobia doesn’t like to talk about the cause of the friction between them. Nevertheless, he felt for decades that he had to stick to his own path; he joked that, whenever he comes to Il Palazzetto now, he tries not to look at the staircase. But it remains the only project by his father that he has ever taken on — the pair’s lone, uneasy collaboration. And it was Tobia who ultimately had the last word when, in 2007, he gave Il Palazzetto its finishing touch: a lofty rectangular glass awning poised on thin fluted iron pylons that shelters the ground-floor entrance. Humbler and smaller than his father’s stairway, it is a postscript all his own and one that, for both families, marks the closing of a circle. As Tobia said to Ferdinando when he agreed to take on this final job, “from father to son, and son to father.”</body>

	<title>Mini to Maestro, Part 1: Crosswords for Beginners</title>
	<author>Isaac Aronow</author>
	<body>Here’s a not-so-well-kept secret for you: Everyone can solve the New York Times Crossword.If you’re already rolling your eyes, take it from us: Jackie Frere, community engagement manager, and Isaac Aronow, associate editor of Gameplay. Jackie was someone who had tried the Monday crossword once, failed, got embarrassed and gave up completely. Isaac has been solving for a while but fell out of practice at the start of the pandemic. We challenged ourselves to see if we could start fresh and complete a Saturday New York Times Crossword in the matter of weeks. Spoiler alert: We did.In case you didn’t know, the daily New York Times Crossword has a difficulty curve as the week goes on. Monday is the easiest puzzle, and then Tuesday is a little harder, climbing up to Saturday, which is the hardest day of the week. Sunday puzzles are sometimes asserted to be the most difficult puzzle of the week, but much of that difficulty comes from the larger size of Sunday puzzles, rather than the clues, the answers or the themes.The Mini doesn’t have a difficulty curve like the daily crossword, so how tricky it is depends more on the individual puzzle you do, rather than the day of the week it runs on. Minis rarely include advanced solving elements like a rebus (more on those later) but will often include intermediate solving elements that are common in midweek puzzles. If you’re comfortable solving minis, we suggest that you’ll be comfortable solving daily crosswords up to Wednesday.It takes time, practice and a little help from the Games team, but you too can solve a Monday puzzle and, eventually, a Saturday crossword. Let us show you how.If you haven’t heard of the Mini, it’s a five-by-five daily crossword created by Joel Fagliano, a senior puzzle editor. It’s free, it includes pop culture clues, and it can most likely be solved in a matter of minutes — or seconds, the more you play.Dip your toe in the crossword water by solving the Mini every day. You’ll gather a feel for how the tools work on the app or the web, and you’ll start to gain confidence in your solving skills.Let’s solve the Mini from Feb. 8, 2022 together:Once you’ve gotten the hang of completing the Mini for about a week or so, it’s time to try a Monday puzzle.Opening up the daily crossword can be daunting, especially if it’s your first time solving. Don’t be scared! Contrary to popular belief, the crossword is not a competition over how much trivia one knows. Yes, random facts and knowledge will come in handy when you’re filling out the crossword grid, but believe in yourself.When attacking the grid head-on, take a few tries to figure out your style of solving. Jackie likes to go around the grid and fill in what she knows. Then she’ll continue to go back through and see if her memory has been prompted by any letters that were filled in or if an answer has “just come” to her the second or third time around. Isaac likes to start with easier clue types, like fill-in-the-blanks or abbreviations.Rachel Fabi, a Wordplay columnist, takes a different approach. “I start every puzzle the same way: I start in the northwest and work my way through,” she said. “So it’ll be going back and forth between across and downs in the corner and then building off of what you have, until you have the whole thing.”Have you gotten as far as you can? Try using autocheck to make sure your answers are correct. Do you need to adjust anything? Go ahead. If you’re still stuck, check out Wordplay, your new best friend. Wordplay is a daily column written by Games editors that explains tricky clues, answers and more about the New York Times Crossword. That one word Rachel, Deb Amlen or Caitlin Lovinger provides there may be the key you need to unlock the rest of your puzzle. And they’re great at explaining what certain crossword clues are asking you to do, or how they might trick you.Now that you have some tools under your belt, let’s solve the Monday from March 21, 2022 together:Take some time to get comfortable with solving Monday puzzles, and don’t be afraid to use the tools we mentioned above. “The more you solve, the better you get and the quicker you are with these things — but just trust yourself; you’re going to get further than you think you will,” Sam Ezersky, a digital puzzles editor, said. “And when you keep coming back to these Monday puzzles, you’re going to continue to make more progress.”For extra homework, read Deb’s guide on “How to Solve the New York Times Crossword.” It’s filled with tips, tricks and definitions of crossword lingo. We didn’t say this would be easy!Here are five Mondays Rachel Fabi, Wordplay columnist, recommends:Aug. 2, 2021Aug. 30, 2021Sept. 20, 2021Nov. 29, 2021Feb. 7, 2022Honestly, Tuesdays aren’t that much harder than Mondays. A big lesson to learn is to make your solving experience your own. Some hard-core puzzlers may consider using autocheck or Google to be cheating, but at the end of the day, you should solve the puzzle in the way that’s most comfortable for you. Google a word or answer if you don’t know it. You might learn something new and use that piece of information in a future puzzle.The beauty of a crossword puzzle is that you won’t know all the answers. That’s the fun part! It’s a learning game. But you will be surprised by how much you do know. And if you’re stuck, don’t be afraid to take a break. “You have to set it down and come back to it,” Sam said. “I will boldly say that every time you set this thing down and you come back to it an hour later, you are absolutely going to see something that you didn’t see prior.”Another tip to help you crack open a puzzle is knowing a few things about clues. First, clues and their answers must always match. A plural clue will have a plural answer, a clue in another language will have an answer in the same language, the parts of speech will always be the same and the tenses will match. As well, clues with initials or abbreviations in them will always have initialed or abbreviated answers, so the answer to “J. Lo’s former partner” will be AROD, and not ALEX RODRIGUEZ, but there’s an exception for abbreviations used for the sake of brevity — U.S., V.I.P. or M.L.B., for example.And by now, you may have noticed that Mondays and Tuesdays always contain a theme. It’s possible to solve the daily without figuring out the theme, but Rachel suggests always identifying the theme if possible. “It’s so much more satisfying when you figure it out early and then use that to predict what’s coming,” she said. The theme can give you an extra hint if you haven’t figured out other long answers in the grid.We’ll expand more on the concept of themes and themeless puzzles in part 2. But first, try solving Tuesdays until you feel ready for another challenge.Here are five Tuesdays Sam Ezersky recommends:June 8, 2021July 20, 2021Aug. 24, 2021Sept. 28, 2021Dec. 7, 2021</body>

	<title>‘They don’t make them like her anymore’: A crowd in Hyde Park bids goodbye to the queen.</title>
	<author>Emma Bubola</author>
	<body>LONDON — Tens of thousands of people gathered on Monday in Hyde Park to watch Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral, video of which was displayed on large screens. They sat on camping chairs, blankets, ladders and stools, brought their own breakfast or bought sausage and fish and chips from the several food trucks installed for the occasion.The initial festival-like atmosphere became somber when the service at Westminster Abbey started, with the huge crowd watching in silence. They also recited the prayers along with the congregation.“I have cried my eyes out all the way through,” Jess Parsons, 36, wrapped in a British flag, said as she watched the funeral. Ms. Parsons now lives in Paris, but she came back to London just for the funeral. She said she stayed up until early Monday morning distributing tea and coffee to people in “The Queue” who were waiting to view the queen’s coffin at Westminster Hall.“They don’t make them like her anymore,” she said, referring to the queen. “She was a one-off.”Maxine Harris and her friend Ellie Curran, both 28 and wearing black, came to Hyde Park and joined a thunderous applause when the screen showed the funeral procession while the sound of cannons resonated in the air.“Especially with this political climate it’s nice that we can all be together,” Ms. Harris said.“When we get old, we will be able to tell our grandchildren that we were here,” Ms. Curran said.Jeff McNally, 63, from the city of Bournemouth, England, wore a medal embossed with the queen’s likeness that he was awarded in the 1970s, when he served in the Royal Artillery.“I want to say goodbye to my boss,” he said. “Prime ministers come and go, but she has been the one constant thing in my life.”Steven Chow, 46, who moved to Britain from Hong Kong last year, said he came to Hyde Park with his family because of their memories of growing up in Hong Kong when it was under British control. “We want to thank the queen for letting us see the most beautiful Hong Kong,” said Mr. Chow, who had stood in The Queue for 13 hours.</body>

	<title>New York City Faces Potential Fiscal Crisis as $10 Billion Deficit Looms</title>
	<author>Dana Rubinstein</author>
	<body>New York City, battered by economic headwinds and mired in a stubborn pandemic-driven downturn afflicting employment, tourism and tax revenue, is teetering on the brink of a severe budget crisis.For the first time in six years, city officials expect that business tax revenue will decline. Personal income and related tax revenue is expected to fall by 7.7 percent, the largest drop in a dozen years.And Wall Street’s struggles may require the city to fork over billions of dollars to its workers’ pension funds, to meet its obligation to provide guaranteed minimum returns.The city’s commercial office market is on the precipice of a potential work-from-home abyss. The transit system’s financial situation is so grim that the state comptroller has warned that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority may seek more financial support from the city. And while the nation has regained the jobs it lost during the pandemic, New York City is still 162,000 jobs short, with the situation especially dire for Black New Yorkers, whose unemployment rate of more than 10 percent remains nearly three times the national average.Mayor Eric Adams entered office in January as the nation’s largest city faced one of its most challenging periods. The coronavirus pandemic caused tourism and some tax revenues to plunge, while violent crime and unemployment rose.But thanks to an extraordinary flood of federal aid, fiscal disaster was kept at bay, enabling the city to pass a record-breaking $101 billion budget in June.That fiscal buoyancy may soon give way.Last week, the Adams administration directed city agencies to cut their city-funded expenses by 3 percent this year, and 4.75 percent the next. Even the Police Department, which is sometimes exempt from across-the-board belt-tightening, must cut its budget.The mayor sounded the need for fiscal conservatism in the face of a new class-size mandate from Albany that he says will cost at least $500 million a year; impending contract negotiations with the city’s 300,000 workers; a growing population of asylum seekers stretching the city’s shelter resources; and the potential pension shortfall.Overall, the city’s revenue stream is projected to fall this year and next — the first two-year decline in audited state comptroller records, which date back to 1980. The state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, recently said the city faced a potential budget gap in 2026 of nearly $10 billion.“Since I took office in January, we have made public safety and fiscal discipline hallmarks of our administration,” Mr. Adams said in a statement. “We currently face new costs that will increase the city’s obligations by billions of dollars, including growing pension contributions, expiring labor contracts and rising health care expenses. In response, we are asking every city agency to tighten its belt without laying off a single employee or reducing services.”James Parrott, the director of economic and fiscal policy at the New School’s Center for New York City Affairs, said it seemed like the mayor was using the economic downturn “to propose a really conservative budgeting approach at this point, to dampen the expectations that many of the parties out there have for what to expect from the city budget for the next year or two.”New Yorkers have already felt the impact of diminished city services. The city is building fewer units of affordable housing than in years past, emergency response times are up and serious injuries resulting from jail violence have increased.Should the city be forced to cut billions of dollars in spending, it could lead to fewer garbage pickups, fewer protected bike lanes and even fewer police officers on the streets at a time when fears of rising crime are prevalent.The city has suffered far worse economic environments, most notably in 1975, when it recovered from the brink of bankruptcy after the state stripped the city of its fiduciary control and transferred it to newly created oversight boards.City leaders did find ways to cut multibillion-dollar deficits after the post-Sept. 11 economic nosedive — in part by raising property taxes — and the Great Recession, which ended in 2009. A spokesman for the mayor did not respond directly when asked if Mr. Adams would consider raising property taxes, the only tax the city can raise on its own without state legislative approval.The cuts are slated to go into effect in November, though the City Council can object.Arrayed before the mayor is a cast of increasingly hostile counterparties who look askance at austerity and question the timing of his cost-cutting effort. They include labor leaders eager to settle new, more generous contracts, and a City Council that is aggressively reconsidering its earlier approval of recent cuts to the city’s education budget, and whose support for the mayor’s November budget cuts is far from assured.However, Andrew Rein, president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, said the mayor’s budget cuts are an important first step.“Even without a recession, the mayor is facing a really tough fiscal challenge. The recession will make it much, much, much more,” Mr. Rein said.Budget experts anticipate city agencies will grapple with some of these cost-cutting demands by eliminating unfilled job openings. Many of those jobs are open because droves of people have been leaving city government, and the city has struggled to replace them. Some of those experts argue that to demand cuts while expecting agencies to avoid service reductions is unrealistic, particularly since some programs, like the expansion of prekindergarten for 3-year-olds, are dependent on federal aid that is drying up.Four agency leaders said this cost-cutting effort would mean eliminating jobs that need to be filled and would further exacerbate the city’s staffing problems and service delivery issues.“It does affect service delivery in the city, certainly,” Mr. Parrott said. “It will affect the morale of city workers.”By many accounts, morale and service delivery are already suffering.As of this summer, the city government’s overall job vacancy rate was 7.9 percent — roughly five times higher than in recent years, according to the most recent data from the Citizens Budget Commission. Nearly 25 percent of jobs at the Buildings Department remain empty. The Parks Department has had trouble hiring entry-level staff, information technology workers and lifeguards.A recent survey by the Managerial Employees Association found that more than 70 percent of members who responded said they had taken on more work thanks to colleagues leaving their agencies.Opposition to the mayor’s cuts is growing.Adrienne Adams, the speaker of the Council, recently described the administration’s decision to freeze hiring as part of its cost-cutting efforts as “counterproductive.”Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, agreed, and on Friday sent a letter to the budget director warning that “imposing a hiring freeze at this time could put at risk critical programs that New Yorkers rely on.”When Mr. Adams, a former police officer, was running for election last year, he won support from several of the city’s most influential labor unions, which represent many Black and Latino New Yorkers. Mr. Adams is expected to seek their support again in his re-election campaign, for which he is already raising money.While union leaders could theoretically hold off on contract negotiations until the economy improves and the city is in a better position to award raises, union members may be too restive to wait.In an email to members on Tuesday, Michael Mulgrew, head of the United Federation of Teachers, indicated as much.“We plan to move as aggressively as possible to reach a deal given how inflation has raised the cost of living over the past year,” he said.Henry Garrido, executive director of the city’s largest municipal union, District Council 37, has adopted a similar stance.“We ask the mayor to stop making the mistakes of the past by cutting vital services, and urge him to come to the table to negotiate in good faith,” he said in a statement issued last week.Mr. Garrido said in an interview that the union’s top priorities would include higher wages and a policy that would allow employees to work from home where appropriate.“We’re having a serious issue with recruitment and retention,” Mr. Garrido said. “We have a lot of competing organizations that are trying to recruit and retain our members, particularly in health care and information technology.”At the moment there is only enough money set aside for 1.25 percent raises, a number that even the mayor acknowledges will not suffice.“We’re clear, that this is a beginning not an ending,” Mr. Adams said earlier this month at a state Financial Control Board meeting. “However, while we are committed to paying fair wages, we will not make deals that the city cannot afford.”</body>

	<title>Biden Says the Pandemic Is Over. But at Least 400 People Are Dying Daily.</title>
	<author>Sheryl Gay Stolberg</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — With 400 to 500 Americans still dying every day of Covid-19, President Biden has declared that “the pandemic is over.”But don’t tell that to people like Debra McCoskey-Reisert, whose mother died in early August. Or Ben HsuBorger, who has chronic fatigue syndrome, a condition often brought on by viruses, including the coronavirus. Or Peter W. Goodman, whose wife died on Aug. 17.“It’s not over for me,” said a tearful Mr. Goodman, 76, who is retired after working as a journalism professor at Hofstra University on Long Island. Both he and his wife, Debbie, 70, became sick with Covid-19 last month. He recovered. She did not.The president made the remarks while speaking in an interview that aired on CBS’s “60 Minutes” on Sunday night. By Monday morning, the backlash was in full swing — as patients said the president was being insensitive at best, and some public health experts said his words were at odds with the science.“We’ve had two million cases reported over the last 28 days, and we know underreporting is substantial,” said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Minnesota. Covid-19, he said, “continues to be the No. 4 cause of death in the country.”In the “60 Minutes” interview, which was taped during the Detroit Auto Show last week, Mr. Biden did allow that “we still have a problem with Covid.” But he also gave a nod to the unmasked crowds at the show.“The pandemic is over,” he said. “If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.”The word from the White House on Monday was that the president was simply expressing what many Americans were already feeling and seeing and what Mr. Biden had been saying all along — that the nation has vaccines and treatments to fight the coronavirus and that for most people, it is not a death sentence.Xavier Becerra, Mr. Biden’s health secretary, echoed the sentiment while getting his booster shot at a community health clinic in New York.“I think the president was reflecting what so many Americans are feeling and thinking,” Mr. Becerra said, “that Covid has disrupted our lives for so long, but we’re also finding that with these effective vaccines, with masking, with the efforts to protect our children, seniors, we are learning how to cope with this virus. But make no mistake. People are still dying.”But it’s one thing for ordinary Americans to think and feel that the pandemic is over; it is another thing for the president to say it. Presidential pronouncements carry policy implications, and the Biden administration had to answer questions on Monday about whether the president’s words would change anything.The short answer: No, they will not.Mr. Becerra’s agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, said the Covid-19 public health emergency, which gives the government flexibility to waive or modify requirements for health-related programs like Medicare and Medicaid, remained in effect.Much of Mr. Biden’s domestic agenda is entangled with the coronavirus pandemic as well. Late last month, his administration announced it was canceling $10,000 in federal student loan debt for certain borrowers to ensure that they were “not placed in a worse position financially because of the pandemic.”The White House is also pressing Congress to appropriate an additional $22 billion to fight the pandemic. The president’s comments could complicate that effort — as well as the administration’s campaign to persuade Americans to take the newly authorized “bivalent” booster shots, just as a possible fall surge is coming, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Center for Pandemic Preparedness and Response at the Brown University School of Public Health.“An unfortunate sound bite,” she said of Mr. Biden’s remarks.Other experts said Mr. Biden was just plain wrong.To begin with, the president does not have the authority to announce an end to the pandemic. The World Health Organization, an arm of the United Nations, designated the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic in 2020. If anyone is responsible for declaring an end, experts say, it would be the organization and its director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“We are not there yet,” Dr. Tedros said last week. “But the end is in sight.”In the United States, data show that the pandemic is in what Dr. Osterholm calls a “high plains plateau.”Gone are the peaks and valleys that came and went with the Omicron surge in late 2021 and early 2022. Hospitalizations are now declining, though roughly 32,000 Americans are still hospitalized with coronavirus infection each day, according to a New York Times database. The number of deaths today is far lower than it was a year ago, when the Delta variant was causing nearly 2,000 deaths per day.“We still have 400 to 500 people dying daily in this country,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University in Atlanta. “If that’s over, it’s a little too high to me.”And for many Americans who are still experiencing the fallout from the worst public health crisis in a century, Mr. Biden’s remarks — and the suggestion that the nation is moving on — were painful. Many of those who are now dying of Covid-19 are either older (Ms. McCoskey-Reisert’s mother, Roberta, was 81) or have underlying illnesses (Mr. Goodman’s wife had lupus, which made her vulnerable).“Let’s not make premature declarations,” said Ms. McCoskey-Reisert, a retired business professor from Citrus Springs, Fla., whose mother died on Aug. 6. “People are still dying.”The pandemic, she said in an interview, feels like “a hell that I am never going to get out of.” Her husband has a compromised immune system, she said, and she is still wearing masks.“President Biden said, ‘No one’s wearing masks,’ and perhaps that is true,” she said. “But is it wise?”Mr. Goodman, who worked as a music and arts reporter for Newsday before he turned to teaching, got sick shortly after he and his wife, Debbie, had returned from a cruise along the Rhine. He said he had no idea how they contracted Covid-19 — it could have been on the plane, where few people were wearing masks, or in the airport, or on the ship, where someone they ate with had a cough.He said he does not regret the trip; his wife, who also had a lung disorder, consulted with her pulmonologist, who said it was fine for her to go. He is glad, he said, that they had that time together. He said he was trying not to pay attention to statistics.“How many people are still dying a day — is it 400 people a day?” he asked. “It’s not over. It may feel over. Probably if it weren’t for my situation, I might feel that it was over, too, but I’m in a situation where it doesn’t matter whether other people think it’s over. It’s not over for me.”Others say their lives are forever changed.“For us, there is no normal that we can go back to,” said Mr. HsuBorger, seated in a wheelchair. He had just led a group of patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis, a complex disorder also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, in a protest outside the White House. Many have long Covid. Their T-shirts declared: “Still Sick. Still Fighting.”Sharon Otterman and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.</body>

	<body>When your floors are littered with dirt, wood shavings or spilled cereal, having a well-designed broom and dustpan at the ready can make the cleanup a lot easier.“When you’re doing work, it’s more pleasurable to use something that’s properly designed,” said Taylor Levy, who, with her husband, Che-Wei Wang, runs CW&amp;T, a Brooklyn design studio that won the National Design Award for product design from the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum this month. “Details matter, because tiny frustrations and tiny pleasures add up.”Functionality is important, of course, but so are aesthetics. Why? Because you’ll be more inclined to leave a good-looking broom out in the open rather than burying it at the back of a closet.“If you can keep it out, you’ll use it — and if you can’t, you’re not going to use it as much,” Ms. Levy said. “And a broom is something you’ll actually want to use all the time.”Should the broom have a nesting dustpan? It’s not essential, but it is a nice feature, Mr. Wang said: “You can put it away really cleanly, it looks nice, and the dustpan has a home.”What will you be using the broom for? “There are brooms for the backyard, brooms for a gross basement and brooms for the kitchen,” Ms. Levy said. “You don’t want to mix and match all of those. Each serves a different purpose.”How long will it last? Longevity is difficult to predict, but it’s wise to invest in a broom made from durable materials, said Mr. Wang, who recently snapped a cheap broom handle by accident: “It’s so incredibly frustrating when things break.”Broomcorn whisk with wood and galvanized-metal dustpan$50 at American Broom Shop: americanbroomshop.comNatural, black or black-tipped broom with oak handle$75 at Lostine: 215-825-7270 or lostine.comBroom with colored cord handle$24 at Darling Spring: 917-456-5437 or darlingspring.comBeech and horsehair broom with dustpan from Iris Hantverk$120 at Goodee: 888-223-1783 or goodeeworld.comBroom and dustpan from Bürstenhaus Redecker with embedded magnet for storage$98 at Jayson Home: 800-472-1885 or jaysonhome.comFor weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.</body>

	<title>Scholars Ask Congress to Scrap Winner-Take-All Political System</title>
	<author>Blake Hounshell</author>
	<body>If there’s one thing we know about America’s creaking democracy, it’s this: Whenever it seems fundamentally broken, people get together to try to fix it.That’s happening now. We’re living through one of the United States’ periodic bursts of reformist energy, with various groups pushing to alter the structure of our elections even as — or rather because — millions of voters on both sides of our partisan divide question the integrity of the system.The latest entry is a roster of more than 200 American political scientists who have put forward a sweeping proposal to change the way the United States has conducted its federal elections for nearly 250 years.In a sharply written open letter to Congress published on Monday and shared in advance with The New York Times, the scholars tell lawmakers, “It is clear that our winner-take-all system — where each U.S. House district is represented by a single person — is fundamentally broken.” They call on Congress to “adopt inclusive, multimember districts with competitive and responsive proportional representation.”The list of signatories includes nine of the 18 living U.S.-based winners of the Johan Skytte Prize, a prestigious Swedish award that has become a kind of unofficial Nobel for political science: Robert Axelrod, Francis Fukuyama, Peter J. Katzenstein, Robert Keohane, David D. Laitin, Margaret Levi, Arend Lijphart, Philippe C. Schmitter and Rein Taagepera.“Our arcane, single-member districting process divides, polarizes and isolates us from each other,” the professors write. “It has effectively extinguished competitive elections for most Americans, and produced a deeply divided political system that is incapable of responding to changing demands and emerging challenges with necessary legitimacy.”In simple terms, what these professors are proposing is a shift from …Districts where voters in each of the two major parties first choose their representatives through partisan primaries, then select a single winner during the general election… to:A system in which voters choose multiple members to represent the same area, with votes allocated proportionally to the population.That general approach is already in use in Arizona, although, importantly, the districts are still winner-take-all. But it’s widespread in other countries, and advocates argue that it dilutes the power of extremist parties.In the Czech Republic, for instance, changes to the election system resulted in a moderate coalition government last year in spite of fears that far-right candidates were gaining momentum.In the United States, changing the federal election system nationwide would require an act of Congress.It would be politically tricky to pull off, to put it mildly. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution grants states the authority to set “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives.” But it also gives Congress the power to “at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations.”That ambiguity means there’s ample room for dispute about whether Congress or the states are the appropriate decision maker. Republicans, at least recently, have tended to argue that states ought to have the primary say in how federal candidates are elected, while Democrats are more often in favor of national-level changes.Much depends on whose ox is being gored. Republicans have long thought they benefited from partisan gerrymandering, especially in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where the G.O.P. is overrepresented in state legislatures relative to their share of statewide votes.The letter writers argue that the change would “render gerrymandering obsolete” and “help ensure that a political party’s share of votes in an election actually determines how many seats it holds in the House.”They also say it would dilute the impact of the Supreme Court’s recent moves to weaken the Voting Rights Act because it would empower communities of color, which often find themselves on the losing end of elections unless they make up an absolute majority of a district.One factor powering the shift in favor of multimember districts is the failure of independent redistricting commissions to bring about fundamental change.After redistricting in 2010, when Republicans used their newfound legislative majorities in many states to redraw the maps for state legislatures and House seats aggressively, Democrats vowed to even the score the next time.In several states — especially Arizona, Michigan and New York — voters’ attempts to fix what they saw as excessive gerrymandering ended in widespread disappointment, with partisan bickering over the makeup of the commissions, the authority of elected leaders to override them and other issues.According to the Cook Political Report, only 33 House districts are tossups, meaning that they are competitive in general elections. A further 23 districts are classified as leaning toward Democrats or Republicans, meaning that only in a wave election are they likely to change hands.For state legislatures, the numbers are even starker. In Pennsylvania, for instance, one party or another often doesn’t even bother fielding a candidate. In 2020, before the latest remapping process, only 25 out of 218 districts of the Statehouse were decided by under 10 percentage points, according to a New York Times analysis.The basic framework for change has been kicked around for years — primarily but not exclusively on the left.Some in Congress have taken up the cause, including Representative Donald S. Beyer Jr. of Virginia, a Democrat who built his fortune through a chain of auto dealerships in the suburbs of Washington.Beyer has a bill, the Fair Representation Act, that proposes multimember districts with proportional representation. The twist is that the legislators would be selected through ranked choice, a system used most recently to elect Representative Mary Peltola of Alaska in a special election.Beyer’s bill has won praise from advocacy groups, but it has attracted only eight co-sponsors — none of them Republicans. It is not likely to move forward during this Congress, his deputy chief of staff said in an email.But Ben Raderstorf, a policy advocate at Protect Democracy, a nonprofit group, said the broader concept of fundamental changes to the electoral system was gaining momentum.For instance, the editorial board of The Boston Globe has endorsed it, as has Jesse Wegman, who wrote an Opinion essay in The Times on the subject. (The Times’s Opinion section is separate from the newsroom.)“The dam is starting to break,” Raderstorf said, pointing to widespread disappointment among reformers with the results of independent redistricting.He also noted what he called the Trump effect — the idea that the former president’s nonstop fanning of conspiracy theories and his embrace of fringe candidates, often in highly gerrymandered Republican districts, was shining a harsh light on the weaknesses of America’s winner-take-all election system.As my colleague David Leonhardt writes in a deep look at what he calls the “twin threats” to American democracy, however, partisan gerrymandering is only part of the story.So-called geographic sorting of conservatives and liberals into rural and urban enclaves probably accounts for a greater portion of how Republicans and Democrats have become so polarized over the last half-century.After all, Leonhardt notes, gerrymandering is not a factor in the outcomes of noncompetitive districts like New York’s 14th, an overwhelmingly Democratic area of the Bronx that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won by nearly 45 percentage points in 2020.Ocasio-Cortez’s safe seat allows her to take wildly popular positions on the left, raise grass-roots money from all over the country and then redeploy those funds to bolster challengers to lawmakers she deems insufficiently progressive.The result is a weakening of the party establishment, a phenomenon that is even more pronounced on the right.On the Republican side, the hollowing out of the official party organs helped give us the Trump presidency and far-right House members like Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.Many G.O.P. members of Congress now live in fear of facing a primary challenge —  worries that have deepened as Trump has thrown his weight around within the party.On paper, Trump’s track record so far this cycle is mixed. According to my colleague Alyce McFadden, who keeps a spreadsheet of his endorsements, the former president’s preferred candidates won all but a handful House primaries during this campaign season.But often, Trump’s influence on Republican politics is more subtle. Much like the tractor beam on the Death Star, it creates a gravitational pull that leads most politicians on the right to orient their positions in his direction.Eli Zupnick, a co-founder of Fix Our House, an advocacy project that favors proportional representation, said that moving away from a winner-take-all system would help politically homeless politicians like Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who lost a Republican primary this summer, to compete and win across the country.“Right now, we have a system where more than 90 percent of districts elect members in low-turnout primaries that reflect only the priorities of each party’s respective bases,” Zupnick said.But the proposed changes, he said, “would force parties to compete across the country for every voter, and each district would elect representatives that truly reflect the values and priorities of that district.”A New York Times/Siena College poll found Democrats faring far worse than they have in the past with Hispanic voters. But Jennifer Medina, Jazmine Ulloa and Ruth Igielnik write that, overall, the party has maintained a hold on the Latino electorate.Nearly two years after Donald Trump refused to accept his defeat in the 2020 election, some of his most loyal Republican acolytes might follow in his footsteps, Reid J. Epstein writes.Democrats and Republicans are running parallel campaigns, with one party emphasizing abortion and democracy, the other inflation and the economy. Jonathan Weisman writes that each side is talking past the other.Thank you for reading On Politics, and for being a subscriber to The New York Times. — BlakeRead past editions of the newsletter here.If you’re enjoying what you’re reading, please consider recommending it to others.

	<title>Your Monday Evening Briefing</title>
	<author>Matthew Cullen</author>
	<body>(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.)Good evening. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday.1. Hurricane Fiona batters Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.The storm poured as much as 30 inches of rain in Puerto Rico, knocking out power to the entire island, stranding more than 1,000 people and killing at least one. Fiona then moved west to the Dominican Republic, where heavy rain and 90-mile-per-hour winds caused mudslides that damaged highways and closed economically important resorts.In Puerto Rico, it is expected to take several days for power to be restored to the fragile grid. The storm’s catastrophic impact there was partly a result of restricted federal aid, slow rebuilding from prior hurricanes and climate change. Just a third of customers in the territory had running water on Monday.The storm is set to pass near Turks and Caicos tomorrow before strengthening into a major hurricane. It is not forecast to approach the mainland. Follow our tracker.2. Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest in a grand state funeral.Culminating 10 days of collective grief and gratitude in Britain, the queen’s coffin was lowered into the royal vault of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where she was buried next to her husband, Prince Philip.An acute sense of uncertainty was also present. With the death of the queen — the country’s last link to its imperial age — questions arose about the future of the monarchy.The queen’s funeral was as majestic a visual experience as her time on the throne. Here are some of the symbols that she leveraged during her historic reign.3. A Russian missile exploded near a second nuclear site.The missile landed less than 900 feet from the reactors of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, narrowly avoiding a possible nuclear calamity. There was no damage to essential safety equipment at the plant, Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company said. But the blast, which caused extensive damage around a hydroelectric power station near the nuclear complex, demonstrated Russia’s ability to threaten disaster despite recent battlefield setbacks.Rebuilding from Russian attacks has become a constant task for Ukrainians since the initial invasion. Explosions have destroyed so many windows that there is a nationwide run on glass.In other news from the war, Russia and China have agreed to carry out more joint military exercises, signaling that whatever misgivings Beijing may have over the war in Ukraine, the nations’ strategic partnership is only growing closer.4. A judge overturned the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, the case at the center of the first season of the podcast “Serial.”Syed, who walked out of prison after 23 years behind bars, had been serving a life sentence. He had been convicted of murder for the strangulation of his onetime girlfriend Hae Min Lee, whose body was found buried in a park in Baltimore County in 1999. Questions about whether Syed had received a fair trial drew widespread attention when “Serial” debuted in 2014. Prosecutors now have 30 days to decide if they will proceed with a new trial or drop the charges against Syed, who was ordered to serve home detention until then.In other legal news, the trial of Thomas Barrack, a former adviser to Donald Trump accused of acting as an unregistered agent of the United Arab Emirates, could shed light on how foreign governments jockeyed for access to the Trump administration.5. New York City is considering housing migrants on cruise ships.Mayor Eric Adams said the city was looking for “creative ways” to address a “humanitarian crisis,” and his administration spoke with executives of Norwegian Cruise Line about the possibility of housing asylum seekers on one of its ships. The city has said that more than 11,000 people have arrived from the border since May, many sent on buses by Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas.But homeless advocates called the idea insulting and raised concerns over providing people access to transportation, food and schools.In other immigration news, one asylum seeker who was bused from Texas to Washington, D.C., has taken advantage of the trip, finding reliable work and a new life. 6. A rural doctor gave her job all she could during the pandemic. She paid a price for it.Physicians suffer one of the highest burnout rates among professionals. Kimberly Becher spent eight years as a family physician in Clay County, W.Va., working for a federally qualified health center. As one of only two family doctors in the county, she had an all-encompassing job.But as the political climate around Covid grew heated, and as some of her patients began to dismiss the science behind the vaccine, Becher became angry. She began to run more, sometimes twice a day, for hours at a time, “raging down the road,” she said. Then, on April 17, 2021, her heart broke.In other health news, the new Covid boosters are one of the last remaining weapons against the coronavirus, as masks and quarantines have diminished. But so far, the rollout has mostly been muted.7. Russian trolls worked tirelessly to fracture the Women’s March.Days after American feminists took to the streets to protest Donald Trump in 2017, organizations tied to the Russian government assigned teams to adopt fictional personas and post messages critical of the Women’s March.They posted as Black women critical of white feminism, conservative women who felt excluded and men who mocked participants as hairy-legged whiners. But fabricated narratives around Linda Sarsour — a Palestinian American activist — garnered the most engagement. Over 18 months, 152 Russian accounts produced material targeting Sarsour, who was a lightning rod for Trump’s base and for some of his most ardent opposition.8. The Yankees’ Aaron Judge is chasing the record books.With 59 home runs through 146 games, Judge is on pace to set both the Yankees and the American League single-season record. A late-season surge could even bring him close to the totals of the power hitters of the steroid era, including Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds.Judge has also placed himself in contention to claim the rare achievement of a triple crown, an impressive feat in which a batter leads his league in batting average, home runs and runs batted in. “That’s remarkable,” said Gerrit Cole, a Yankees pitcher. “It’s the greatest offensive season that I’ve personally ever witnessed.”In other sports news, The Las Vegas Aces beat the Connecticut Sun to win their first W.N.B.A. championship.9. A nice-looking broom can help make your house look better.Functionality is important, of course: You’ll want it to be sturdy and hassle-free.

	<title>Arrests at Southwestern Border Exceed 2 Million in a Year for the First Time</title>
	<author>Eileen Sullivan</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — For the first time, the number of arrests of undocumented immigrants along the southwestern border exceeded two million in one year, according to newly released government data, continuing a historic pace of undocumented immigrants coming to the country.The number of arrests at the border increased slightly from July to August, with a total of more than 2.1 million for the first 11 months of the 2022 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.In an unusual step, Biden administration officials gave some reporters a background briefing on Monday before Customs and Border Protection’s routine monthly release of data. Officials noted that the number of removals over the past year — more than 1.3 million — was more than any previous year.The administration in recent months has tried to steer clear of immigration issues as the midterm elections approach and Republicans campaign on the message that the border is unsecured. Last week, two Republican governors paid for dozens of immigrants who were released from government custody to be transported to Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., an escalation of efforts to show Democratic areas inside the country what it is like on the southwestern border.The immigrants sent to those locations crossed the southwestern border without documentation and underwent security screenings by border officials before they were released into the country temporarily to face removal proceedings. They are part of a global movement of displaced people who are fleeing their home countries. In June, the United Nations said that one in 78 people across the world were considered displaced. Venezuelans are estimated to be the second-largest group of displaced people around the world. (Syrians are the largest.)In August, the number of immigrants from Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela caught crossing the southwestern border was nearly the same as the number of immigrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, marking a stark shift in the nationalities of people coming to the United States compared with previous years. The number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras is down 43 percent from August 2021; the number of Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans is up 175 percent.“Failing Communist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba are driving a new wave of migration across the Western Hemisphere, including the recent increase in encounters at the southwest U.S. border,” the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Chris Magnus, said in a statement on Monday.Because the United States lacks diplomatic relations with those three countries, officials cannot repatriate the migrants as they do with people from other countries.Since President Biden’s first days in office, more than one million people have been released by border authorities to face removal proceedings, according to data submitted in monthly status update filings in legal challenges to this administration’s immigration policies.Many of the immigrants who have been crossing the southwestern border are seeking asylum, a legal right that was significantly restricted through several policies during the Trump administration when there was also a spike in migration. One of those policies is the use of a public health rule, known as Title 42, which the Biden administration tried to end in late May. Louisiana and other predominantly Republican states sued to stop the administration from lifting the order.The journey to the United States is grueling, dangerous and expensive, with migrants often paying smugglers to get across. The Biden administration has deployed more than 1,300 law enforcement agents and officers to Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras in an effort to counter the smuggling operations. One of the administration officials speaking on background on Monday said officials believed this had stopped 57,000 immigrants a month from getting to the southwestern border. Mr. Biden announced the countersmuggling campaign in June.</body>

	<title>At Summer’s End, a Moment of Wild Surprise</title>
	<author>Margaret Renkl</author>
	<body>NASHVILLE — Then, just like that, the light changed, taking on the autumnal slant that turns dust motes into flecks of fire and deepens the color of songbirds’ feathers, so bright and new now after the August molt. Suddenly it is fall, whatever the temperature might suggest.There are two ways of marking the change of seasons. Meteorological fall begins on the first day of September. Astronomical fall begins with the autumnal equinox, which this year occurs on Thursday. The disparity between the dates is owing to the specialties involved: Astronomers account for the changing seasons by observing the earth’s tilt, while meteorologists, it probably goes without saying, divide the seasons according to the weather. For meteorologists, summer is comprised of June, July and August, the three hottest months of the year.In Tennessee, summertime temperatures have always persisted long past the first day of meteorological fall. Nowadays they persist long past the first day of astronomical fall, too. Often it is still summer here deep into October, even November. Sometimes there is no fall at all — we go directly from roasting to freezing, and the leaves drop from the trees without ever pausing to blush.The planet is tilting anyway, and many migratory creatures take their cue from the changing light even as all the others are still panting in the shade.This year we all got a surprise break. Early in September, a front rolled in from the north, bringing foggy mornings and cooler nights. The temperature dropped and the dew point dropped, and everything changed. It felt the way I imagine it might feel to be a troubled soul welcomed unexpectedly into heaven.The break in the heat was never going to last. Nevertheless, “We must risk delight,” as the poet Jack Gilbert writes in “A Brief for the Defense,” and the loveliness held for longer than I had any reason to hope — day after day of blessedly cooler mornings, dewy mornings with the bumblebees in the balsam flowers sleeping late, waiting to be warmed into flight again. My dog Rascal stopped giving me the side eye when I invited him for a walk. I ought to have used the break in the heat to pull the invasive creeping Charlie and mulberry weed out of my flower beds, but I could only sit on our stoop with the skinks, soaking in the tender sun.The wild creatures in our yard go about their business in all the usual ways of autumn, adjusting as they always do to both the changing light and the cooler temperatures. Our resident broadhead skink suns herself a little more often on the front stoop these days, sometimes joined now by a five-lined skink and a smaller broadhead. I had to stick a Post-it note to the storm door to remind myself to make sure it latched behind me whenever I stepped outside. I don’t want Rascal to get out and terrorize our skink neighbors.Best of all, September ushered in the butterflies.It has been a poor year for butterflies until now. I’d seen quite a few skippers, plus a few clouded sulphurs and a couple of hackberry emperors, but only one ragged gulf fritillary and not a single swallowtail or monarch. It has been a surprisingly good year for bees in this yard, and that’s heartening, but fate seemed to have other plans for the butterflies.Then a female monarch showed up, followed by a tiger swallowtail followed by a black swallowtail. A few days later a second monarch arrived, this one a male, and stayed in the pollinator garden all day long. Another gulf fritillary found our native purple passion vine, and then another found it too. Before long I was seeing gulf fritillaries every day, and most were laying eggs. Now the passion vines are covered with gulf fritillary caterpillars. Soon the passion fruits will ripen and fall to the ground, where they will feed the squirrels and raccoons, skunks and foxes. I have a bumper crop of passion fruits this year, thanks to the industrious carpenter bees. It’s been a good year for bees in more ways than one.In “Braiding Sweetgrass,” Robin Wall Kimmerer tells the story of her first-year intake interview at the university’s forestry school. When the interviewer asked her to explain her choice of major, she writes, “I told him that I chose botany because I wanted to learn why asters and goldenrod looked so beautiful together.”I think of her story every year when the passion vines are feeding the gulf fritillary caterpillars, and the carpenter bees are pollinating the passionflowers, and the passion fruits are ripening to feed everybody else. The whole lovely cycle is happening just behind the place in my pollinator garden where the goldenrod and the asters look so beautiful together.People ask me sometimes if I had to wait for my parents to die before I could write my first book, an account of my happy but complicated childhood. What they are asking, I know, is how my parents would feel to find themselves the subject of a book that doesn’t gloss over the family sadness that seems to be inevitable, even within happy childhoods.No, I always say. My parents were humiliatingly proud of me, and they loved it when I wrote about our family. They would dearly have loved to see themselves in a book with my name on the cover.But there is one sense in which the answer to such questions is also yes. My parents had to die, and my children had to grow up, before I could let myself settle into the sweetness of the earth again, before I could drop the vigilance of caregiving, the constant scrolling worries of caregiving, and be restored, if only at times, to the state in which I spent my childhood: unaware of time and its relentless, despotic unfolding.I didn’t believe, back in the days of tending others’ needs, that I could give myself over to the pleasure of sitting on a front stoop in the morning sunshine. I could have — I absolutely could have done it — but it seemed impossible.And yet, even then, time was passing. Summer was giving way to fall, year in and year out, and fall was giving way to winter. Gradually, without even noticing it, I began to surrender to the moments again — to the timeless time of sleepy bees and sunning lizards and nodding flowers and butterflies that float from aster to goldenrod all the mild day long.Margaret Renkl, a contributing Opinion writer, is the author of the books “Graceland, at Last: Notes on Hope and Heartache From the American South” and “Late Migrations: A Natural History of Love and Loss.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Widespread business and public service closures put Britain’s economy on hold.</title>
	<author>Eshe Nelson</author>
	<body>On Monday, as Queen Elizabeth II is laid to rest, much of Britain will pause.The day has been designated a public holiday, but the sweeping closures of public services and corporate activity are more extensive than on other holidays as 10 days of collective mourning come to an end. Alongside the sudden shuttering of schools and many workplaces, non-urgent medical appointments in the backlogged National Health Service have been canceled and a vast array of businesses including restaurants, gyms and stores will be shut.“As a mark of respect, and in order to allow our team members the opportunity to join the national mourning” most Boots stores, a large chain of drugstores, will be closed on Monday, the company said in a statement. Tesco, Britain’s largest supermarket chain, is shutting all of its large stores for the day alongside most other major supermarkets. Even McDonald’s is closing all of its restaurants across Britain until 5 p.m.Chain stores selling clothes and household goods will mostly be closed, as will London’s luxury department stores, including Harrods. Still, some parts of normal British life will go on, as many pubs have said they will remain open.Public holidays tend to disrupt the economy and lead to a slowdown in economic growth statistics for the month they are in. With Britain already suffering from a stagnating economy amid an energy crisis and 40-year high inflation, the interruption to activity on Monday could be enough to tip the country into a recession, with two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, analysts have said.“The slow start” to the third quarter, when the economy grew just 0.2 in July from the previous month, and the extra holiday, “should put the economy on course for a technical recession — albeit a marginal one,” an analyst at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note last week.When the period of mourning ends and something closer to normality resumes on Tuesday, the pressing questions of how households and businesses get through the winter and how the government can brighten Britain’s gloomy economic outlook, which is troubling investors, will return with full force.</body>

	<title>Criminal Investigation Is Opened After Migrant Flights to Martha’s Vineyard</title>
	<author>Eliza Fawcett</author>
	<body>SAN ANTONIO — A county sheriff in Texas announced on Monday that he had opened a criminal investigation into flights that took 48 migrants from a shelter in San Antonio to the island resort of Martha’s Vineyard last week.Sheriff Javier Salazar of Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, said that he had enlisted agents from his office’s organized crime task force and that it was too early to determine which laws might have been broken. But he said it was clear that many of the migrants had been misled and lured away from Texas to score political points.The migrants, caught in a mounting political fight between Republican governors of border states and Democratic officials, were flown to Massachusetts by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida last week. A day later, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas sent two busloads of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris’s residence in Washington.A migrant appears to have been paid to recruit other Venezuelan migrants, who have been crossing the southwest border in greater numbers, from the area around a migrant resource center in San Antonio, Sheriff Salazar said. The migrants were “lured under false pretenses” with promises of work and a better life, he added.“They had a right to walk around the streets just like you and me, and they had a right not to be preyed on and played for a fool and transported halfway across the country, just for the sake of a media event or a video opportunity,” Sheriff Salazar, a Democrat, said. “That’s a tragedy.”Where were the migrants from? The 48 migrants who were taken from a shelter in San Antonio to Martha’s Vineyard in mid-September are Venezuelans who had crossed the southwest border without authorization and had turned themselves in to border officials; many likely planned to claim asylum. After being taken into custody, they had been released to face future proceedings.Who flew them to Martha’s Vineyard? Why? The migrants were sent to the island in two planeloads by Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a Republican. The move was one in a series of similar drop-offs, often by bus, to Democratic strongholds orchestrated by Republican governors in recent months as a way to provoke public outrage over migrant arrivals at the border.What happened to the migrants after they arrived on the land? Volunteers and officials in Martha’s Vineyard welcomed the migrants with food and clothing and gave them shelter at a local church. A few days later, the migrants boarded buses for a temporary shelter at Joint Base Cape Cod.Are the drop-offs legal? Once migrants have been released and served documents to appear in court, they are free to travel within the United States; it is not illegal for a state government to pay for that travel. But on Sept. 20, the migrants taken to Martha’s Vineyard filed a lawsuit against Mr. DeSantis and other state officials, accusing them of engaging in a “fraudulent and discriminatory scheme” by lying about where they were being taken.Are the claims being investigated? Yes. A county sheriff in Texas has opened a criminal investigation into the drop-offs, saying that it was clear that many of the migrants had been misled and lured away from Texas to score political points. The sheriff, who has been a critic of the Republican handling of illegal immigration, added that his decision to open the investigation was not politically motivated.Many of the migrants who have sought asylum and work in the United States in recent months are fleeing Venezuela, which is in political and economic turmoil. More than two million undocumented immigrants, a record, have been arrested along the southern border this fiscal year, according to Customs and Border Protection data released on Monday.The Venezuelan migrants who were taken to Martha’s Vineyard said they had traveled for more than two months, crossing the perilous Darién Gap before continuing through Central America and Mexico.In interviews with reporters, they described being approached in San Antonio by a well-dressed woman who introduced herself as Perla; she handed out gift cards for fast-food restaurants and offered to take them to “sanctuary” in Massachusetts.After the migrants unexpectedly arrived on Martha’s Vineyard, volunteers and officials welcomed them with food and clothing and gave them shelter at a local church. A few days later, the migrants boarded buses for a temporary shelter at Joint Base Cape Cod.Taryn Fenske, the communications director for Mr. DeSantis, said in a statement that the migrants had been more than willing to leave Bexar County after being abandoned there. “Florida gave them an opportunity to seek greener pastures in a sanctuary jurisdiction that offered greater resources for them,” she said.In Massachusetts, she added, the migrants were “provided accommodations, sustenance, clothing and more options to succeed following their unfair enticement into the United States, unlike the 53 immigrants who died in a truck found abandoned in Bexar County this June.”Sheriff Salazar said he had not ruled out the possibility of working with state and federal officials on the criminal case. His office has yet to interview the migrants, who are now on the East Coast, and has communicated mainly with one of the lawyers representing them, he added.The sheriff, who has been a constant critic of the Republican response to illegal immigration, stressed that his decision to open the investigation was not politically motivated.“It’s doing the right thing,” he said.Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>¿Qué es la niebla cerebral y cómo puedo tratarla?</title>
	<author>Knvul Sheikh</author>
	<body>P: Me cuesta recordar cosas y a menudo me siento agotado, como si no pudiera despejar mi cabeza. ¿Es niebla cerebral? ¿hay algo que pueda hacer para solucionarlo?El espacio en blanco en tu mente, cuando aparece, puede ser confuso. ¿Qué estabas diciendo? ¿Tenías que recoger pollo y zanahorias de camino a casa, o era solo el pollo? ¿Por qué de repente es tan difícil prestar atención a lo que estás haciendo y por qué parece que tu cerebro es de repente 30 años más viejo que tú?Si te sientes lento y olvidadizo, te distraes con facilidad o te sientes completamente abrumado por las tareas cotidianas, puedes estar experimentando un fenómeno común conocido como niebla cerebral. Aunque no se trata de un diagnóstico clínico oficial que aparezca en un historial médico, la niebla cerebral puede surgir después de varias noches de insomnio, cuando se toman ciertos medicamentos como los antihistamínicos, o como resultado del jet lag, entre otras muchas situaciones. Algunas personas experimentan una forma de niebla cerebral después de una comida abundante, durante periodos especialmente estresantes de la vida o cuando se producen grandes cambios hormonales, como durante el embarazo o la menopausia.La niebla cerebral también puede ser un síntoma de enfermedad; puede ocurrir con la enfermedad de Lyme, el lupus y la esclerosis múltiple, después del tratamiento del cáncer o incluso durante un resfriado especialmente fuerte.En los últimos años, el término también se ha asociado estrechamente con el deterioro cognitivo que muchas personas experimentan durante o después de luchar contra la COVID-19. Aproximadamente entre el 20 y el 30 por ciento de los pacientes de covid tienen alguna niebla cerebral que persiste o se desarrolla durante los tres meses posteriores a su infección inicial, y más del 65 por ciento de los que tienen covid persistente informan también de síntomas neurológicos. “Se está convirtiendo en una crisis de salud neurológica”, afirma Michelle Monje, neuróloga de la Universidad de Stanford que ha estudiado el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la quimioterapia y el coronavirus.Independientemente de cuándo o cómo se produzca, la niebla cerebral puede ser frustrante y preocupante. Los problemas cognitivos pueden aparecer y desaparecer, tanto en el caso de la niebla cerebral relacionada con la covid como en otros tipos, indicó Jacqueline Becker, neuropsicóloga clínica del Hospital Mount Sinai de Nueva York. Pero si los síntomas persisten durante varias semanas o dificultan la vida angustiosamente, hay que buscar una evaluación médica.“Hay algunas personas que son capaces de seguir con sus trabajos y su vida habitual, pero es posible que necesiten descansos más frecuentes entre las tareas”, dijo Becker. “Y luego hay otras personas que simplemente están completamente incapacitadas por esto”.Aunque la niebla cerebral suena a una condición vaga y temporal, como un mal tiempo que se despeja con el paso de las horas, las investigaciones empiezan a demostrar que puede afectar a algunas personas durante meses y apoderarse de muchos aspectos de la vida, a diferencia de la pereza u olvido corrientes. La niebla cerebral tiende a afectar a la función ejecutiva, un conjunto de habilidades esenciales para la planificación, la organización de la información, el seguimiento de instrucciones y la multitarea, entre otras cosas. “Cuando la función ejecutiva está deteriorada, suele afectar a varios ámbitos de la capacidad cognitiva”, afirma Becker.Muchos médicos prefieren utilizar el término “deterioro cognitivo” para dar más legitimidad médica a lo que padecen los pacientes, e inician el proceso de diagnóstico con exámenes cognitivos que se emplean para medir la función ejecutiva en enfermedades graves como la demencia, añadió Becker. La diferencia clave es que la niebla cerebral no empeora progresivamente como sucede con las capacidades mentales en la demencia. Es posible que algunos días sean peores que otros, pero la niebla cerebral tiende a afectar la función cognitiva en la misma medida cada vez.Diversos análisis de sangre también pueden ayudar a identificar algunas causas de deterioro cognitivo, como la apnea del sueño, la deficiencia de vitamina B u otros problemas hormonales y tiroideos, afirma Joanna Hellmuth, neuróloga de la Universidad de California en San Francisco. Pero como la niebla cerebral puede presentarse de tantas formas diferentes, y como tiene tantas causas distintas, las pruebas de diagnóstico tienen sus limitaciones, añadió.A veces, la niebla cerebral puede ser difícil de diagnosticar porque está causada por varios factores diferentes, incluso en el caso de un paciente que padece una enfermedad general. Una persona con lupus o esclerosis múltiple, por ejemplo, puede experimentar un deterioro cognitivo debido a un daño directo en sus células cerebrales, pero también puede no estar durmiendo lo suficiente, tener una gran fatiga o estar tomando medicamentos que contribuyen a la niebla cerebral.A diferencia del lupus y la esclerosis múltiple, el daño directo a las células cerebrales es mucho más raro en la COVID-19. Pero los cerebros de algunos pacientes muestran una desregulación en sus células endoteliales, que recubren los vasos sanguíneos del cerebro. Esto puede dar lugar a una barrera hematoencefálica más permeable, que permite el paso de sustancias nocivas al cerebro y modifica la función cognitiva, explica Hellmuth.Los investigadores están descubriendo que una causa más común de la niebla cerebral en los pacientes de covid, así como en los infectados por otros virus como el VIH y el ébola, e incluso en las personas que se someten a quimioterapia para el cáncer, es la inflamación —un aumento brusco e injustificado de la actividad de las células inmunitarias que puede causar estragos— en el cerebro y el cuerpo. Los estudios demuestran que los pacientes con deterioro cognitivo persistente después de la COVID-19 tienen altos niveles de marcadores inflamatorios en la sangre y el líquido cefalorraquídeo. “Solo estamos viendo un nuevo virus que crea el mismo problema de siempre”, afirma Avindra Nath, director clínico del Instituto Nacional de Trastornos Neurológicos y Accidentes Cerebrovasculares.Incluso si los médicos no hallan una causa física para la niebla cerebral, hay medidas que se pueden tomar para manejarla, dijo Hellmuth. Comienza con estrategias de adaptación a corto plazo para gestionar las tareas cotidianas. Escribe notas y programa alarmas para no faltar a tus citas. Tómate descansos regulares durante los proyectos largos para poder mantener la concentración y terminar las tareas. También puedes probar a hacer un seguimiento de tus actividades diarias, utilizando una aplicación en tu teléfono o simplemente un cuaderno para averiguar en qué momentos del día te sientes con más energía y lucidez. A continuación, reserva ese tiempo para realizar tareas más difíciles o complicadas.El médico también puede sugerirte que hagas cambios en tu estilo de vida para mejorar tu salud y energía en general. “Intentamos fomentar el ejercicio cardiovascular, una buena dieta, el sueño y las actividades sociales que se sabe que son beneficiosas para el cerebro”, dice Hellmuth.La actividad física puede ayudar a mejorar la capacidad de concentración, así como a aumentar la conectividad neuronal y la formación de la memoria en el cerebro. Si no sientes ganas de hacer entrenamientos rigurosos, prueba a hacerlos en pequeños intervalos para ir aumentando poco a poco tu capacidad aeróbica. Asegúrate de mantenerte hidratado y de comer una variedad de alimentos ricos en vitaminas y antioxidantes. Y acude a tus amigos y familiares para que te apoyen. Los estudios han demostrado que mantener una rica red social no solamente ayuda a reducir el estrés en los momentos difíciles, sino que también puede aumentar la estimulación intelectual y mejorar tu salud cerebral.También querrás descansar mejor, lo que, por supuesto, es más fácil de decir que de hacer para los pacientes con covid persistente, los que se someten a quimioterapia o los que experimentan cambios vitales como el embarazo o la menopausia. Toma medidas para relajar tu mente por la noche. Desenchufa los aparatos electrónicos y crea un entorno de descanso.Monje dijo que algunos pacientes también han encontrado alivio tomando medicamentos utilizados para tratar el TDAH y otros problemas de atención. Y los ensayos clínicos que se están llevando a cabo actualmente para medicamentos que ayudan con los trastornos cognitivos relacionados con la quimioterapia pueden proporcionar nuevos tratamientos en el futuro.El equipo de Becker en Mount Sinai dirige un ensayo clínico de un programa de rehabilitación cognitiva con la esperanza de poder enseñar al cerebro a reconectarse y reducir los síntomas de la niebla cerebral. La rehabilitación consiste en aprender y practicar habilidades para mejorar la memoria y la atención, así como en entrenar la regulación de las emociones para ayudar a los pacientes, dijo.“El cerebro es extremadamente maleable”, afirma Becker. “Hay pruebas sustanciales de que el cerebro puede recuperarse después de lesiones cerebrales traumáticas y después de accidentes cerebrovasculares, y eso me da la esperanza de que la recuperación después de la niebla cerebral es posible”.</body>

	<title>How a Quebec Lithium Mine May Help Make Electric Cars Affordable</title>
	<author>Jack Ewing</author>
	<body>About 350 miles northwest of Montreal, amid a vast pine forest, is a deep mining pit with walls of mottled rock. The pit has changed hands repeatedly and been mired in bankruptcy, but now it could help determine the future of electric vehicles.The mine contains lithium, an indispensable ingredient in electric car batteries that is in short supply. If it opens on schedule early next year, it will be the second North American source of that metal, offering hope that badly needed raw materials can be extracted and refined close to Canadian, U.S. and Mexican auto factories, in line with Biden administration policies that aim to break China’s dominance of the battery supply chain.Having more mines will also help contain the price of lithium, which has soared fivefold since mid-2021, pushing the cost of electric vehicles so high that they are out of reach for many drivers. The average new electric car in the United States costs about $66,000, just a few thousand dollars short of the median household income last year.But the mine outside La Corne, operated by Sayona Mining, an Australian company, also illustrates the many hurdles that must be overcome to produce and process the materials needed to wean automobiles from fossil fuels. The mine has had several owners, and some of them filed for bankruptcy. As a result, some analysts and investors warn that many mines being developed now may never be viable.Dozens of lithium mines are in various stages of development in Canada and the United States. Canada has made it a mission to become a major source of raw materials and components for electric vehicles. But most of these projects are years away from production. Even if they are able to raise the billions of dollars needed to get going, there is no guarantee they will yield enough lithium to meet the continent’s needs.Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, said in July that being a lithium supplier was a “license to print money.” But it is also a risky, volatile business. Ore buried deep in the earth may have insufficient concentrations of lithium to be profitable. Opposition from environmental groups or nearby residents can delay or kill projects.Mines tend to be in remote locations. By industry standards, Sayona’s mine, which is at the end of a 12-mile gravel road, is just around the corner. Many other projects are far more inaccessible. After the price of lithium fell by half from 2017 to 2020, the mine’s previous owner, the Chinese battery maker CATL, shut down operations and sought protection from creditors for the subsidiary that owned the property. Sayona, working with Piedmont Lithium, a lithium mining and processing company based in Belmont, N.C., bought the operation last year.Some investors believe the hype around lithium is overblown and have been betting against mining companies. They believe that some of the companies lack the expertise to blast ore, haul it out of the earth and separate the lithium from the surrounding rock. Lithium projects often suffer delays and cost overruns.The risk is reflected in the gyrations of Sayona shares traded on the Australian Securities Exchange in Sydney. They peaked at 36 Australian cents (24 U.S. cents) in April, plunged to 13 cents in June and have recently traded at around 28 cents.“Those of us in the industry are quite confident that lithium will be in short supply for the next decade,” said Keith Phillips, chief executive of Piedmont Lithium, which owns 25 percent of the Sayona’s Quebec project. He added, “Others are taking a contrarian view.”For many people in government and the auto industry, the main concern is whether there will be enough lithium to meet soaring demand for electric vehicles.The Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden signed in August, has raised the stakes for the auto industry. To qualify for several incentives and subsidies in the law, which go to car buyers and automakers and are worth a total of $10,000 or more per electric vehicle, battery makers must use raw materials from North America or a country with which the United States has a trade agreement.The world will also need more refineries, the plants where raw lithium is processed into a concentrated form of the metal that goes into batteries. Most lithium is processed in China, and Piedmont and other companies plan to build refineries in the United States. But lithium processing requires expertise that is in short supply, said Eric Norris, president of lithium at Albemarle, a mining and processing company in Charlotte, N.C.Lithium is the lightest known metal, and its ability to store energy makes it attractive for batteries. But lithium deposits come embedded in other metals and minerals. That is why extracting lithium can be incredibly difficult.The mining industry “has not honed its ability, broadly speaking, to build conversion capacity repeatedly and consistently,” Mr. Norris said, noting that even his company, which has extensive experience, has suffered delays building processing plants.Albemarle operates the only active lithium mine in the United States, in Silver Peak, Nev., where the metal is extracted from brine, a liquid found beneath the ground. Some Tesla batteries contain lithium from Nevada, but the site’s total annual output is enough for about 80,000 vehicles. Americans bought 370,000 battery-powered cars in the first six months of 2022, according to Kelley Blue Book, and sales are rising fast.Albemarle also produces lithium in Chile and Australia. The company is working to reopen a lithium mine in Kings Mountain, N.C., and plans to build a refinery in the Southeast.Even those large projects will not be enough to satisfy demand as California and other states move to ban internal combustion engines. “It’s going to take everything we can do and our competitors can do over the next five years to keep up,” Mr. Norris said.One of the first things that Sayona had to do when it took over the La Corne mine was pump out water that had filled the pit, exposing terraced walls of dark and pale stone from previous excavations. Lighter rock contains lithium.After being blasted loose and crushed, the rock is processed in several stages to remove waste material. A short drive from the mine, inside a large building with walls of corrugated blue metal, a laser scanner uses jets of compressed air to separate light-colored lithium ore. The ore is then refined in vats filled with detergent and water, where the lithium floats to the surface and is skimmed away.The end product looks like fine white sand but it is still only about 6 percent lithium. The rest includes aluminum, silicon and other substances. The material is sent to refineries, most of them in China, to be further purified.Yves Desrosiers, an engineer and a senior adviser at Sayona, began working at the La Corne mine in 2012. During a tour, he expressed satisfaction at what he said were improvements made by Sayona and Piedmont. Those include better control of dust, and a plan to restore the site once the lithium runs out in a few decades.“The productivity will be a lot better because we are correcting everything,” Mr. Desrosiers said. In a few years, the company plans to upgrade the facility to produce lithium carbonate, which contains a much higher concentration of lithium than the raw metal extracted from the ground.The operation will get its electricity from Quebec’s abundant hydropower plants, and will use only recycled water in the separation process, Mr. Desrosiers said. Still, environmental activists are watching the project warily.Mining is a pillar of the Quebec economy, and the area around La Corne is populated with people whose livelihoods depend on extraction of iron, nickel, copper, zinc and other metals. There is an active gold mine near the largest city in the area, Val-d’Or, or Valley of Gold.Mining “is our life,” said Sébastien D’Astous, a metallurgist turned politician who is the mayor of Amos, a small city north of La Corne. “Everybody knows, or has in the near family, people who work in mining or for contractors.”Most people support the lithium mine, but a significant minority oppose it, Mr. D’Astous said. Opponents fear that another lithium mine being developed by Sayona in nearby La Motte, Quebec, could contaminate an underground river.Rodrigue Turgeon, a local lawyer and program co-leader for MiningWatch Canada, a watchdog group, has pushed to make sure the Sayona mines undergo rigorous environmental reviews. Long Point First Nation, an Indigenous group that says the mines are on its ancestral territory, wants to conduct its own environmental impact study.Sébastien Lemire, who represents the region around La Corne in the Canadian Parliament, said he wanted to make sure that the wealth created by lithium mining flowed to the people of Quebec rather than to outside investors.Mr. Lemire praised activists for being “vigilant” about environmental standards, but he favors the mine and drives an electric car, a Chevrolet Bolt.“If we don’t do it,” he said at a cafe in La Corne, “we’re missing the opportunity of the electrification of transport.”</body>

	<title>Our Predecessors Built a World of Winners and Losers. It’s Time for Something Different.</title>
	<author>Darren Walker</author>
	<body>Our international rules-based order through which the world’s nations pursue global peace and development is crashing into the limits of its founding vision. What our predecessors built some eight decades ago, after the Second World War — from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to the United Nations — is in desperate need of repair. But it remains essential, and salvageable.For billions of people, the stakes could not be higher. This is painfully true for the people of Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin continues his malevolent invasion of a sovereign nation and subversion of international law. It’s also true across the Global South, where I believe our global development finance system has proved outdated, outmoded and outmatched.We must reform the architecture of our global order — the blueprint for our system of international relations and development finance.Group of 7 countries, major global-development organizations and big global foundations remain too uncomfortable, too unwilling, to expand their range of funding and planning partners, especially stakeholders from the Global South. Many of us assume that our so-called expertise is more valuable or relevant than the experience of the communities affected by today’s crises.Of course, these are precisely the individuals and organizations to whom we should be listening, because they are most proximate to the problems that we can only solve together.According to a recent study from the United Nations Development Program, during 2020 and 2021, nine of every 10 countries have actually slid backward on the Human Development Index, a first in the three-decade history of this trusted report on health, education and standards of living. These findings set in sharp relief the staggering costs and consequences of our cascading global crises, all of which are aggravated by inequality.During the pandemic, the global order failed to sufficiently finance vaccine distribution and access, costing countless lives and inflicting incalculable damage on the economies of poor nations. As the world transitions to recovery, the inequities are only widening, both between and within countries.The picture is hardly better for what should be a shared effort to mitigate and adapt to the global climate emergency and to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals more broadly. In 2009, for example, the world’s wealthy nations pledged that, by 2020, they would contribute $100 billion every year to help poor nations prepare for the consequences of climate change. Our system has now failed to meet even that modest goal three years in a row, and counting.This system was founded to serve a simple, powerful ideal: peace through economic engagement. Never again would the United States and Europe allow widespread economic depression and dislocation to recreate the conditions that led to isolationism, nationalism, fascism, and global conflagration.This vision found its consummate expression at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, where delegates created the World Bank and International Monetary Fund — and then in the charter of the United Nations a year later. With support from a range of institutions, including the Ford Foundation, it evolved and expanded to include a plethora of development agencies, a complex mix of government, multilateral, and civil society organizations.By and large, this system of international cooperation helped achieve its original objective: preventing the horror of a third world war. It sustained peace and prosperity, at least for the West, and ushered in unprecedented (if not uncomplicated) social and economic progress around the world.At the same time, and from the start, this order was rife with flaws. For one, it did little to impede the proxy wars of world powers, particularly the United States and Soviet Union, across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.For another, it reinforced and even replicated the inequalities it ought to have dismantled, dividing the world into donors and recipients, creditors and debtors, givers and takers, winners and losers. It became a new face of imperialism and colonialism.Today, the challenges that face this order compound on one another.We’re engaged in a generational contest between authoritarian ideology and democratic values in countries the world over, including our own, but we’re responding with the cutting-edge thinking of the 1940s.The consequences of climate change, the next pandemic or next recession will not be relegated to one country or another, but experienced first and worst by the poor and vulnerable in every country, jeopardizing everyone’s security in turn.Global leaders should commit to three principles for reform, to repair historic wrongs and to seize new opportunities for progress.First, we must recognize that growth is good, but not good enough. We need metrics beyond G.D.P. to measure and manage toward what matters most: the human rights and human dignity of people in every country.Second, we must think bigger and bolder, but also for the longer term. We know that investment in equitable development today is far more cost effective than dealing with the consequences of our failure to invest during the decades ahead.Most important, we must ensure that the people affected by 21st-century crises — and the development community’s responses to them — have a voice in shaping policies and programs that serve them.The global community can start immediately by releasing more resources, currently tied up in development organizations, and by listening to and learning from inspiring leaders across the Global South.Ultimately, though, we can and must reorganize our efforts around the needs of people and communities, not just nation states, so governments, civil society and private sector entities all work in common purpose toward a global common good.Darren Walker is president of the Ford Foundation.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>The schedule of events for the day.</title>
	<author>Emma Bubola</author>
	<body>Buckingham Palace officials have detailed minute-by-minute plans for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II on Monday. Here are some of the key events.In the morning, heads of state and foreign royals will gather at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a home for retired soldiers in West London. From there, they will travel together to Westminster Abbey.At 6:30 a.m. local time (1:30 a.m. Eastern), the doors of Westminster Hall, where the queen had been lying in state, closed to the public in preparation for her coffin to be moved to the abbey for her funeral.The abbey will open at 8 a.m. for invited attendees.A procession will accompany the queen’s coffin from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey at 10:35 a.m. The route will be lined by members of the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, and the procession will be led by about 200 musicians, including the pipes and drums from the Scottish and Irish Regiments. The carriage will be followed by King Charles III and members of Britain’s royal family.At 11 a.m., the funeral service will be conducted by the dean of Westminster, with readings by Prime Minister Liz Truss and Patricia Scotland, the secretary general of the Commonwealth. The archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, will give the sermon.Toward the end of the ceremony, two minutes of silence will be observed across Britain. The service is to end at noon.A procession will then follow to Wellington Arch, near Hyde Park, before the coffin is driven to Windsor, about 24 miles to the west.At Windsor Castle, the hearse will join a new procession to St. George’s Chapel. There, a committal service will take place at 4 p.m. The service will be conducted by the dean of Windsor and is open to the queen’s past and present staff members, including those who have worked on private estates.Before the final hymn, the crown jeweler will remove the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the scepter, which are resting on top of the coffin, and place them onto the altar.After the hymn, the coffin will be lowered into the royal vault, a burial chamber under the chapel. The archbishop of Canterbury will pronounce the blessing, which will be followed by the singing of “God Save the King.”The burial service that will follow, at 7:30 p.m., also conducted by the dean of Windsor, will be private.</body>

	<title>Hay buenas noticias sobre los refuerzos de las vacunas contra la covid</title>
	<author>Zeynep Tufekci</author>
	<body>Por primera vez, Estados Unidos está lanzando vacunas contra la COVID-19 actualizadas para las variantes que predominan en este momento, así como para la cepa original. Esta bivalencia no solo permitirá responder mejor a las variantes más amenazadoras que existen hoy, sino probablemente también a las futuras, porque, cuando el sistema inmune se enfrenta a distintas versiones del mismo virus, genera unas protecciones generales más amplias.Esto es una gran noticia, y aún hay más. No solo las dosis de refuerzo de las nuevas vacunas disminuirán la probabilidad de contagios y enfermedades graves, además de ayudar a mitigar la transmisión del virus: también podría reducir la probabilidad de la covid prolongada.¿Cuál es la mala noticia? Se les está dando tan poca publicidad, y hay tanto escepticismo injustificado en torno a ellas, que muy pocas personas podrían ponérselas, y que enfermen, sufran o mueran muchas otras que no tendrían por qué enfermar, sufrir o morir.Los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE. UU. han dicho que, en una encuesta nacional, el 72 por ciento de los encuestados dijo que era muy probable que se pusieran la dosis de refuerzo actualizada. Sin embargo, para que en efecto se vacunen, es necesario facilitar su acceso a las dosis de refuerzo y asegurar que la gente conozca sus ventajas.El coordinador de la respuesta al coronavirus de la Casa Blanca, Ashish Jha, dijo la semana pasada que la gente podría contemplar ponerse la dosis cuando se vacune contra la gripe, como hacen muchas personas en octubre, y, salvo que surja otra gran oleada de una nueva variante, considerarla como una vacuna anual en adelante. Eso estaría bien si la gente lo hace, y más teniendo en cuenta que, según muchos inmunólogos, es mejor esperar entre 3 y 6 meses desde la última vacunación o contagio, y muchas personas se han contagiado hace poco.Sin embargo, solo alrededor de la mitad de los adultos estadounidenses se vacunan contra la gripe, y la mayoría no se puso las anteriores dosis de refuerzo contra la COVID-19. Sin una vigorosa campaña de sensibilización y promoción, millones de estadounidenses que no son antivacunas, pero que necesitan un pequeño empujón, se quedarán sin esta valiosa dosis.Si bien han sido deprimentes las tasas de dosis de refuerzo entre los republicanos —muchos de los cuales se han posicionado contra las vacunas—, también es muy probable que se queden atrás muchos de los estadounidenses más vulnerables, incluso los vacunados con la pauta inicial. Entre aquellas personas sin las dosis de refuerzo anteriores, a pesar de estar vacunadas con la pauta inicial, había una probabilidad más alta de que careciesen de seguro médico, de que fuesen negras o hispanas o más pobres o tuviesen un menor nivel de estudios.Entretanto, con el estancamiento del Congreso se han interrumpido la financiación y distribución de estas vacunas: los demócratas no incluyeron nuevos fondos para la pandemia en el paquete de gasto de mayo porque podía ir en detrimento de los fondos de estímulo para los estados, y ahora se enfrentan a la resistencia de los republicanos a aprobar la asignación de nuevos fondos para la pandemia. Probablemente, ahora habrá menos centros dedicados ad hoc a la sensibilización sobre las vacunas de los que había antes.Benjamin Mueller informó en el Times de que los departamentos de salud locales están lidiando con la escasez de personal y el brote de viruela del mono, mientras tratan de poner al día la inmunización de los niños. Además, algunos funcionarios sanitarios parecen creer que es suficiente dejar que cada persona busque vacunarse por su cuenta, principalmente en lugares privados, como las farmacias: en lo que va de año, solo se han asignado 550 millones de dólares a la vacunación a través de la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA, por su sigla en inglés), frente a los 8500 millones de dólares del año pasado.Las dosis de refuerzo son de especial ayuda para las personas mayores o con problemas de salud previos, pero a menudo esos grupos tienen que superar algunos obstáculos para acceder a la vacunación. El año pasado, hubo campañas para llevar la vacunación a los centros de mayores y los lugares de paso en las comunidades, o para ayudar a las personas a desplazarse a los centros de vacunación o incluso vacunarlas en su domicilio. Los funcionarios de la Casa Blanca me dicen que siguen intentando llevar a cabo esas campañas, pero reconocen que se hará solo en la medida que lo permitan unos recursos cada vez menores. Sin ese apoyo, ¿cuántas de las personas que más riesgo corren se quedarán sin la dosis de refuerzo, y a las que en otras circunstancias no les habría faltado la voluntad?Aunque las personas jóvenes y sanas que se hayan vacunado y hayan pasado por una infección posvacunación sin complicaciones corren un riesgo mucho menor de desarrollar una enfermedad grave, se preferible que eviten enfermarse o tener el riesgo de una covid persistente. Pero vayamos más allá de las ventajas personales: a pesar de que a veces se diga lo contrario, las vacunas siguen ayudando a mitigar la propagación, y las dosis de refuerzo pueden reducir aún más la transmisión de la enfermedad, incluso los contagios iniciales, y por tanto ayudar a proteger, especialmente, a los más vulnerables.Otra encuesta realizada por la Kaiser Family Foundation reveló que alrededor de un tercio de las personas que se pusieron la vacuna, pero no la dosis de refuerzo, dijeron que el motivo fue que “no habían tenido tiempo”. Esa respuesta fue más frecuente entre los adultos hispanos, citada en el 41 por ciento de los casos. Alrededor de otro 25 por ciento de los encuestados aludió a los efectos secundarios.La baja remunerada tras las campañas de vacunación en el lugar de trabajo y combinar las vacunas antigripales y contra la COVID-19 podrían salvar ese obstáculo. Jha me dice que el gobierno ya les está pidiendo a sus empleados que sigan esos pasos, y falta por ver cuántos los siguen.Después está la falta de información. La mayoría de las personas que se pusieron la vacuna, pero no la dosis de refuerzo (y alrededor de un tercio no prevén ponerse la dosis actualizada), dijeron que ya estaban lo bastante protegidas por las dosis o contagios previos.Muchas de las personas que no se pusieron la dosis de refuerzo anterior o que no prevén ponerse la actualizada dicen que no creen que sean eficaces, una respuesta que se repite a menudo, debido a que la variante ómicron provocó muchas infecciones posvacunación.Se podría refutar todo esto con un mensaje franco y directo: es cierto que las variantes pueden provocar infecciones posvacunación, pero las vacunas siguen previniendo la enfermedad grave y la muerte, y más aún con las dosis de refuerzo.Muchos países europeos y Canadá, por ejemplo, hicieron un mejor trabajo a la hora de conseguir que su población se pusiera la dosis de refuerzo. Sus cifras de muertes y enfermedades desde la ola de ómicron son marcadamente inferiores a las de Estados Unidos, donde solo se pusieron la dosis de refuerzo un tercio de los adultos que cumplían los requisitos, frente a los dos tercios que lo hicieron en muchos países europeos. Estados Unidos ha tenido una tasa de mortalidad un 80 por ciento mayor que la de Canadá debido a la ola de ómicron, una tendencia similar a nivel mundial. En países como Japón, Corea del Sur y Taiwán, en torno al 80 por ciento o más de la población se puso la dosis de refuerzo, y sus cifras de muertos son aún más bajas.Muchas personas quizá se pregunten también por qué deberían tomarse la molestia de ponerse otra inyección, puesto que el 68 por ciento de los estadounidenses están vacunados con la pauta inicial de dos inyecciones, algunos ya se han puesto la dosis de refuerzo y seguramente alrededor del 60 por ciento del país ya posee cierto nivel de inmunidad tras contagiarse de la ómicron.Deepta Bhattacharya, un inmunólogo, me dijo que las variantes habían desarrollado la capacidad de evadir la primera barrera de protección de los anticuerpos generada por las vacunas o los contagios previos, aunque las protecciones frente a enfermedades graves siguen siendo muy sólidas. Sin embargo, las nuevas dosis de refuerzo pueden mermar en gran medida esa capacidad de evasión. Cuando se realizaron los ensayos clínicos de las vacunas iniciales, diseñadas para las cepas que entonces había en circulación, se reportó entre el 90 y el 95 por ciento de protección frente a cualquier contagio sintomático, que después fue decayendo con las nuevas variantes y el paso del tiempo. Aunque aún se desconocen las cifras exactas, todos los inmunólogos con los que he hablado me dijeron que las dosis de refuerzo deberían volver a aumentar esas protecciones.Ya se ha demostrado que las vacunas (y las dosis de refuerzo) reducen enormemente las tasas de covid persistente entre los contagiados, aunque, como es obvio, si se evita por completo el contagio, eso alejaría directamente el riesgo de una covid persistente. El inmunólogo Shane Crotty también señaló que seguramente estas dosis de refuerzo reduzcan aún más la probabilidad de que surjan complicaciones más graves de la enfermedad, incluida la covid persistente, y dice que “cuanto más alto sea tu nivel de inmunidad, menos reproducción vírica tendrás, menor daño vírico y menor probabilidad de covid persistente”.Y cabe esperar que, en adelante, estas nuevas dosis de refuerzo tengan más ventajas, como una mejor protección frente a futuras variantes, al entrenar mejor a los anticuerpos y las células de memoria, que son partes distintas del sistema inmune. Como me dijo Bhattacharya, el contacto con diferentes versiones del virus (como ocurrirá con estas dosis actualizadas) aumenta y refuerza el tipo de anticuerpos que se generan, entre ellos los que pueden trabajar contra variantes futuras. La inmunóloga Marion Pepper me dijo que una nueva vacuna adaptada a las variantes también puede “crear nuevas células de memoria, diferentes entre sí, que contribuyan a la protección frente a la ómicron y otras variantes con las que aún no nos hemos encontrado”.Por desgracia, quizá nos enfrentemos a otro problema que ya vimos durante la pandemia: los funcionarios de la salud pública o médicos con mucha proyección mediática que arrojan dudas sobre las dosis de refuerzo al centrarse en sus imperfecciones, en vez de en sus inmensos beneficios, y que se preocupan por la reacción del público, por motivos como su “hartazgo de las vacunas”.Cuando oigo esa expresión, me preguntó cómo habría sonado en la primavera de 2020, cuando teníamos hospitales de campaña en Central Park, los cuerpos se amontonaban en camiones por falta de espacio en las funerarias y a los hospitales se les agotaban las bolsas para cadáveres.Nunca he entendido esas vacilaciones de las autoridades sanitarias y los médicos por cómo podría reaccionar o no el público. ¿Por qué no simplemente damos información veraz y detallada, y hacemos que sea más fácil vacunarse? Esa es la mejor respuesta al “hartazgo de las vacunas”, aunque pueda seguir costando mucho sensibilizar a quienes son antivacunas comprometidos.Y algunos escritores y científicos han dicho que no se deberían haber ofrecido las dosis de refuerzo hasta haber finalizado sus respectivos ensayos clínicos en humanos. Sin embargo, ya se han realizado amplios ensayos con humanos, para esta vacuna y algunas de sus actualizaciones, y no es nada raro ajustar una vacuna utilizando los datos provenientes del trabajo de laboratorio o con ratones. Es parecido a lo que se hace todos los años para las vacunas antigripales.Es probable que durante el otoño y el invierno pasados hubiese personas que dejaron de ponerse la dosis de refuerzo y que, al menos en parte, fuese porque algunos científicos famosos cuestionaron injustamente la utilidad de las dosis. Ahora se da una dinámica similar, y se les dedica una excesiva atención a cuestiones menores, como la obligatoriedad de las dosis de refuerzo en las universidades. Las imposiciones generales son ahora menos necesarias para los estudiantes universitarios, aunque en algunas residencias de estudiantes quizá las apliquen para proteger a los alumnos médicamente frágiles o darles esa posibilidad a otros. Aun así, a los jóvenes se les debe seguir informando de las ventajas de las dosis de refuerzo, y a las personas mayores o médicamente frágiles se les debe seguir recordando encarecidamente los riesgos que aún presenta la COVID-19. Los funcionarios de la Casa Blanca dicen que lanzarán su propia campaña de mensajes para contrarrestar la confusión: esperemos que funcione.Hay muchos estudios dedicados a los mensajes sobre las vacunas, pero en su mayor parte todo se reduce a generar confianza, a la sinceridad y la transparencia y a hacer la vacunación más fácil. Nuestro terrible sistema sanitario es un obstáculo importante: mantener un trato periódico con el médico puede ser un factor clave, pero a muchos estadounidenses les falta ese trato. No sorprende que, de todos los grupos, los menos propensos a ponerse la vacuna y la dosis de refuerzo sigan siendo los que carecen de seguro.Como se puso de manifiesto durante la pandemia, es la vacunación, y no las vacunas, lo que salva vidas, y habría muchas más personas vacunadas si se les diera información y se les facilitara el acceso. No disponer de las herramientas contra las enfermedades que causan tanto sufrimiento es una tragedia, pero tenerlas y que no se utilicen debería ser, además, inaceptable.Zeynep Tufekci (@zeynep) es profesora adjunta de la Universidad de Carolina del Norte, autora de Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest y columnista de la sección de Opinión.</body>

	<title>El sistema migratorio de EE. UU. es obsoleto. Está claro</title>
	<author>Farah Stockman</author>
	<body>Desde abril, el gobernador de Texas, Greg Abbott, ha enviado en autobús a más de 7900 migrantes a Washington D. C. En agosto, comenzó a enviar migrantes a Nueva York. Ahora, el gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, se está sumando, y envió dos aviones llenos de personas que llegaron a Estados Unidos a Martha’s Vineyard, en Massachusetts. Al referirse al tema, Abbott pone en evidencia a los gobernadores de los estados demócratas que dicen dar la bienvenida a los migrantes indocumentados. También es parte de un plan republicano no tan secreto para incitar la ira contra los demócratas antes de las elecciones intermedias.Dejando de lado la política, una cosa está clara: nuestro sistema migratorio es obsoleto y está sobrecargado desde hace mucho tiempo, y el proceso de asilo es una parte importante de lo que no funciona. El número de nuevas solicitudes de asilo presentadas en los tribunales migratorios de Estados Unidos aumentó de 32.895 en todo 2010 a 156.374 en 2022 y todavía faltan cuatro meses para que termine el año. Esto se debe en parte a que los conflictos y la COVID-19 generaron una migración masiva en todo el mundo. Los tribunales migratorios no han podido seguir el ritmo del aumento de la oleada de recién llegados. En 2010, hubo un retraso de unos 100.000 casos de solicitud de asilo pendientes por resolverse. Estos días, esa cifra aumentó a más de 660.000. Al incluir otro tipo de casos, como las órdenes de deportación, el retraso en los tribunales migratorios aumenta a más de 1,8 millones de casos pendientes.Estas cifras reflejan un incremento reciente en la inmigración. En los últimos dos años, se les permitió ingresar al país a cerca de un millón de personas que esperan una audiencia ante el tribunal migratorio, según un informe reciente de mi colega del Times Eileen Sullivan. A cada persona se le dio un año para presentar su solicitud de asilo. Eso no es solo un fenómeno de la era Biden: el gobierno de Trump admitió un número similar de casos durante un lapso de 24 meses en 2018 y 2019, años en los que se produjo el último gran aumento de la migración.En conjunto, esos números saturaron el sistema. Aunque se supone que las audiencias de asilo deben llevarse a cabo dentro de 45 días de la presentación de una solicitud, el tiempo de espera en este momento promedia casi cuatro años y medio, según datos compilados en el centro TRAC de la Universidad de Siracusa. Cuanto más tarde en resolverse un caso, más difícil será expulsar a la gente cuyas solicitudes de asilo sean negadas, como ocurrió con la mitad de los casos de asilo el año pasado. Se prevé que en 2022 se inicien más de 745.000 procedimientos de deportación, más del doble que en ningún otro año, a excepción de 2019. Los largos retrasos en la resolución de los casos de asilo se han convertido en una grave crisis que se autoperpetúa: esos retrasos incentivan a la gente a presentar solicitudes de asilo infundadas, sabiendo que les hará ganar años, aunque al final acabe por deportárseles.Parte del problema es que el asilo es una de las pocas vías legales a las cuales las personas que están en una situación económica desesperada pueden recurrir para vivir y trabajar en Estados Unidos. Conforme a la legislación estadounidense y a las convenciones de las Naciones Unidas establecidas tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, las personas que expresan un “temor fundado a ser perseguidas por motivos de raza, religión, nacionalidad, pertenencia a un determinado grupo social u opinión política” pueden esperar la resolución de sus casos de asilo dentro de Estados Unidos, donde pueden solicitar autorización para trabajar 150 días después de haber solicitado el asilo. Los documentos de autorización de empleo deben renovarse cada dos años, lo cual genera otro montón de papeleo que la burocracia debe mantener al día.Los solicitantes de asilo cuyos casos son auténticos son los más afectados por estas peticiones falsas, que aumentan de manera considerable el tiempo que deben esperar protección jurídica.El gobierno de Trump puso en práctica diversos métodos encaminados a disuadir a los inmigrantes de presentar solicitudes de asilo, como obligar a algunas personas a permanecer en México mientras presentaban su solicitud en Estados Unidos. Sin embargo, a pesar de ello, las solicitudes de asilo aumentaron bastante durante su presidencia, en parte debido a un aumento en la migración, pero también como defensa contra su esfuerzo intensificado para deportar a las personas.El brote mundial de COVID-19 supuso una nueva oportunidad de disminuir las solicitudes de asilo. El título 42, la política de salud pública relacionada con la pandemia que el gobierno de Trump implementó en marzo de 2020, ha permitido a las autoridades estadounidenses expulsar con rapidez a los migrantes en la frontera sin otorgarles la oportunidad de presentar una solicitud de asilo. A muchos de ellos se les regresa a México, lo cual los expone a más peligro. El gobierno de Biden anunció que reabriría el procesamiento de asilo en la frontera y buscaría poner un alto al uso del título 42, pero más de 20 fiscales generales republicanos presentaron demandas para mantener en vigor dicho título, aun cuando algunos de ellos se opusieron a otros esfuerzos para prevenir la COVID-19 e insistieron en que la pandemia se estaba sobredimensionando. Hasta ahora, un juez federal ha bloqueado los esfuerzos del gobierno para cambiar la política.El título 42 acabará por eliminarse; en ese momento, el país se apoyará en el título 8, la regla que prevalecía antes de la pandemia en virtud de la cual los agentes estadounidenses pueden deportar o multar de inmediato a las personas que sean sorprendidas entrando al país de manera ilegal, a menos que se considere que cumplen los requisitos para solicitar asilo. Esto es justo; un sistema bien gestionado debe estar facultado para descartar y expulsar sin demora a las personas con solicitudes infundadas, al tiempo que conecta a los que tienen casos auténticos con redes de apoyo social. En este frente, el gobierno de Biden no ha recibido el crédito que merece por un importante, aunque subestimado, cambio de reglas que podría reformar el sistema. Este verano, los funcionarios de asilo capacitados han aceptado algunas solicitudes de asilo en un puñado de centros de detención del Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE, por su sigla en inglés) en Texas, lo cual alivia a los tribunales migratorios. La esperanza es que las adjudicaciones rápidas de nuevos casos eviten que el retraso aumente y desalienten las solicitudes falsas o carentes de méritos.La nueva norma no es el tapete de bienvenida que muchos activistas de los derechos de los migrantes querían del gobierno de Biden después de cuatro años del mandato de Trump. Tampoco es el tratamiento de tolerancia cero que muchos republicanos ven como la única manera de disuadir que los migrantes se acumulen en la frontera. Pero es una política sólida basada en recomendaciones y una extensa investigación de grupos respetados, incluido el Instituto de Política Migratoria, que es apartidista. En una era en la cual casi todo lo que un presidente hace en relación con la migración es motivo de una demanda, la regla se redactó con sumo cuidado para evitar los litigios. En combinación con los esfuerzos bipartidistas para aumentar la capacidad de procesar a los no ciudadanos en la frontera en los centros de recepción que tienen todos los departamentos y agencias pertinentes bajo un mismo techo, podría por fin transformar un sistema roto en uno mucho más eficiente, moderno y justo.En una época en la que los estadounidenses ya están en desacuerdo sobre lo que podríamos llamar valores fundamentales —las creencias culturales que mantienen unido al país— es razonable preocuparse de que la llegada de más migrantes complique la tarea de forjar un futuro común. Sin embargo, también es una cuestión que afecta la esencia de lo que somos y si seguiremos siendo un lugar donde los cansados, los pobres y las masas hacinadas del mundo puedan tener una segunda oportunidad. Para ser fieles a nuestra identidad como país pluralista, necesitamos un sistema de asilo que garantice que las personas que reúnen los requisitos para recibir protección puedan obtenerla, al tiempo que se minimiza el abuso del sistema por parte de quienes solo intentan saltarse la fila.Farah Stockman se unió al Comité Editorial del Times en 2020.

	<title>When Fossils Are Accidentally Dug Up, the Job Site Becomes a Science Lab</title>
	<author>Mitch Smith</author>
	<body>KENT CITY, Mich. — It all started with a very large femur.When Kevin Busscher dipped the scoop of his excavator into the soft Michigan soil last month, he knew the thigh bone he plucked from the dirt was far too big to have belonged to a cow or a horse. And he knew the culvert he was replacing would have to wait.“My first thought was, ‘woolly mammoth!’” said Mr. Busscher, who reported his find to the county officials overseeing the project, who relayed photos of the bones to scientists.As it turned out, he had found the skeleton of a mastodon, an elephant-like beast that roamed North America during the last ice age. By the next morning, a team of university and museum researchers had assembled to extract the rest of the bones. When they pulled out the mastodon’s massive jaw, several bright white teeth were still in place.That discovery, a few feet below the ground between a rural road and a hayfield, was the latest in a long tradition of construction workers becoming accidental paleontologists. Over the years, construction crews have stumbled upon horned dinosaurs in Colorado, horse bones dating back thousands of years in Nevada and a mammoth graveyard in South Dakota, turning job sites for new houses, backyard pools and government buildings into spontaneous science labs.“As paleontologists, we wish that we could go out with this kind of heavy equipment and start cutting through, looking through hills and things like that, but we don’t really get to,” said Blaine Schubert, a professor at East Tennessee State University who oversees the Gray Fossil Site and Museum, which became a research area after workers on a highway project discovered a trove of bones in 2000. There is a natural symbiosis between paleontology and construction, both professions where digging in the dirt is part of a day’s work. And because there are so many more construction workers than there are paleontologists, and because of the powerful machinery used for building, it makes sense that construction workers are often the first to uncover bones.Joe Sertich, who until recently was the curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science, said he routinely heard from people who thought they may have found notable fossils. Sometimes they were false alarms or relatively minor finds, like common fish fossils or bones so badly damaged by construction equipment that they held limited scientific value. But every now and then, construction workers stumbled into major discoveries.He helped excavate thousands of ice age fossils, including mammoths, mastodons, camels, plants and insects, at the site of a reservoir expansion in Snowmass Village, Colo. And in the Denver suburbs, at two separate construction sites, one for a police and fire station and another for an assisted living facility, workers turned up horned dinosaur remains.“I put together huge expeditions around the country to go out and spend eight weeks digging in remote field areas, looking for things like horned dinosaurs,” Dr. Sertich said. “And it turns out that some of those finds are sitting right in our own backyards.”In Hot Springs, S.D., work on a housing development stopped abruptly in the 1970s when workers found the skeleton of a mammoth. When Jim I. Mead and other paleontologists went there and started digging, they found another skeleton, and then another. The site, Dr. Mead said, turned out to be a long-ago sinkhole pond where mammoth after mammoth drowned after finding itself unable to climb out. The housing developer agreed to stop building, and decades later, mammoths are still being uncovered there.“We’re totally lucky,” said Dr. Mead, now the director of research at the Mammoth Site, which hosts tourists, school groups and scientists. “It’s just phenomenal that this person said, ‘I want this to be preserved.’”There can sometimes be tension between science and construction. Unlike with human remains and Native American cultural artifacts, there is often no legal requirement in the United States to report paleontological finds on privately owned land, meaning that some animal bones end up being plowed over or sold to private collections instead of turned over for study. And given the tight deadlines facing many construction projects, calling in scientists can be seen as an expensive diversion from the task at hand.Earlier this year in Utah, construction equipment damaged a set of rare dinosaur footprints on federal land, bringing criticism that paleontologists had not been more involved in supervising the site.When Tennessee road workers found what became the Gray Fossil Site more than two decades ago, converting the place into a permanent research area required intervention from the governor and money to reroute the highway that was supposed to go there. In the years since, East Tennessee State University has started a paleontology program, thousands of visitors have stopped at the museum and scientists have unearthed bones dating back about five million years, including red pandas, rhinos, tapirs and alligators, providing a unique lens into prehistoric Appalachia.“It’s telling us what these forests were like at this time, when we had no idea what they were like millions of years on either side,” said Dr. Schubert, who oversees the site, where excavations continue. He added, “It was a tremendously expensive endeavor to save this fossil site, and I don’t know if something like that would happen today.”Scientists know in general terms where dinosaur bones or ice age remains are most likely to be discovered: in places where sediments or sedimentary rock strata of the right age are now close to the surface and may be exposed by natural erosion or construction work. Much of North America meets that description, though, and exactly where important new finds may lie hidden is largely a matter of chance.When fossils do turn up, long-term excavations like the site in Tennessee are the exception. Often, scientists can complete their work in a few days or weeks if construction workers report a notable find. In California, which has stringent laws for alerting scientists about paleontological finds, construction crews and scientists have generally coexisted well. Peter Tateishi, the chief executive of Associated General Contractors of California, said construction workers were often able to continue building other parts of a structure when scientists had to be called in to evaluate a discovery.“That can be a bit of a pain, but the laws are written in such a way that we can continue to keep schedules moving,” Mr. Tateishi said. Dan Wagner, a construction inspector in the Denver area, was helping oversee the building of the police and fire station in Thornton, Colo., a few years ago when he found a hunk of bone where crews were drilling holes for concrete piers. The bone came from deep in the ground, suggesting that it was probably very old. He wondered, “‘Could this be a dinosaur, even?’”When he dug some more and unearthed a much larger bone, the site managers halted work in that area. Over the next couple weeks, as work continued on other parts of the new building, Dr. Sertich and other paleontologists excavated a largely intact Torosaurus in a small, fenced-off section of the building site. Mr. Wagner said he would sometimes check on progress during his breaks, and would join in the digging when his work day ended.“I’ve never been into dinosaurs before, but I was super-excited,” said Mr. Wagner, who got a tattoo of the Torosaurus and later took his children to see it displayed at a museum. “I’d go to bed wondering what the heck it was, and how many bones were going to be there.”In Michigan, where the mastodon bones were found in August, there was never hesitation about giving experts access to the site, where crews had been clearing a long-neglected drain network needed to move water off farmland.“You’re sitting in this spot on this earth that has had a creature that lived here that we have never seen and never will see,” said Ken Yonker, the Kent County drain commissioner, whose agency oversaw the construction project. “It’s almost like a gift.”Mr. Busscher, who found that initial femur and who owns the construction company, let his employees spend the next day working in the dirt with the scientists. The owners of the land where the bones were found agreed to donate the bones to the Grand Rapids Public Museum, which is now conducting an extensive cleaning and drying process to prepare the bones for display.The bones will join other mastodons at the museum, including one partial skeleton known as Smitty, whose bones were found at a housing construction site in Michigan in the 1980s.Cory Redman, the museum’s science curator, who used a garden hose to gently clean dirt off the newly found mastodon’s bones, said it was not yet clear how that skeleton, which probably belonged to a juvenile, came to rest beside that country road north of Grand Rapids. He said researchers may look to see whether the bones, which were at least 11,000 years old and dated back to a time when glaciers covered portions of Michigan, showed any signs of having been butchered by humans.Several days after the discovery, normalcy had mostly returned to the construction site. The excavator that unearthed the femur was still parked in the dirt; water had settled in the hole where the bones were found; and Mr. Busscher and his crew were hard at work beyond the “Road Closed” sign.After all, they still had to finish clearing that drain.</body>

	<title>Bad Bunny retrata la crisis de energía y de desigualdad de Puerto Rico</title>
	<author>Ben Sisario</author>
	<body>Otra semana, otro centenar de millones de reproducciones y otro número uno para Bad Bunny, la superestrella del pop de Puerto Rico cuyo álbum Un verano sin ti ha dominado los peldaños superiores de la lista Billboard desde que salió en mayo.En su decimonovena semana de lanzamiento, Un verano sin ti se anotó una undécima vez en el número uno, la mayor cantidad de veces en la cima desde que Views de Drake tuvo un periodo de 13 semanas en 2016. Las carreras de ambos álbumes no son consecutivas, pero Bad Bunny tiene la distinción de no haber bajado nunca del número 2. (Views cayó hasta el número 4 durante sus primeras 19 semanas de lanzamiento).En su semana más reciente, Un verano sin ti obtuvo el equivalente a 97.000 ventas en Estados Unidos, incluyendo 132 millones de reproducciones en continuo, según Luminate, el servicio de seguimiento que impulsa las listas de Billboard. Desde su lanzamiento, el álbum ha tenido el equivalente a unos 2,4 millones de ventas, y sus canciones han acumulado 3300 millones de reproducciones.Este logro se produce en un momento en que Bad Bunny está agotando las entradas de los estadios de toda Norteamérica —incluidas dos noches en el estadio de los Yankees el mes pasado— y ha abordado los problemas políticos y sociales de Puerto Rico de manera cada vez más directa. El viernes publicó un video de 23 minutos, que pasa de un video musical para su canción “El apagón” a un documental de 18 minutos realizado por la periodista Bianca Graulau, titulado Aquí vive gente.Su película analiza las desigualdades en el sector inmobiliario puertorriqueño, incluido el desalojo de algunos residentes de bajos ingresos de San Juan para dar paso a viviendas millonarias que atienden a los especuladores del continente y a los comerciantes de criptomonedas. “Están desplazando al boricua para hacerse ellos ricos, a través de lo de aquí, de lo nativo de aquí”, le dice a Graulau en el documental una mujer que dijo que le habían dado 30 días para abandonar su apartamento.El video de Bad Bunny también explora los problemas que han perdurado por mucho tiempo con la red eléctrica de Puerto Rico, que ha luchado por recuperarse después del huracán María en 2017. Los apagones de este año provocaron protestas contra Luma Energy, una empresa privada que se hizo cargo de ella en 2021. El video llegó en el momento en que el huracán Fiona dejó sin electricidad a todo Puerto Rico y provocó daños e inundaciones generalizadas.Tres nuevos álbumes se han colocado en lo alto de la lista de éxitos de esta semana. El rapero canadiense Nav se estrena en el número dos con Demons Protected by Angels, mientras que Ozzy Osbourne, el dios del metal de 73 años y alguna vez estrella de la telerrealidad, comienza en el número tres con su último disco, Patient Number 9. El cantante de country Kane Brown debuta en el número cinco con Different Man.También esta semana, Dangerous: The Double Album, de Morgan Wallen, se sitúa en el número cuatro y prolonga su histórica trayectoria en el Top 10: por 87 semanas.Ben Sisario cubre la industria musical. Escribe para el Times desde 1998. @sisario</body>

	<title>Social Media Companies Still Boost Election Fraud Claims, Report Says</title>
	<author>Steven Lee Myers</author>
	<body>The major social media companies all say they are ready to deal with a torrent of misinformation surrounding the midterm elections in November.A report released on Monday, however, claimed that they continued to undermine the integrity of the vote by allowing election-related conspiracy theories to fester and spread.In the report, the Stern Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University said the social media companies still host and amplify “election denialism,” threatening to further erode confidence in the democratic process.The companies, the report argued, bear a responsibility for the false but widespread belief among conservatives that the 2020 election was fraudulent — and that the coming midterms could be, too. The report joins a chorus of warnings from officials and experts that the results in November could be fiercely, even violently, contended.“The malady of election denialism in the U.S. has become one of the most dangerous byproducts of social media,” the report warned, “and it is past time for the industry to do more to address it.”The major platforms — Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube — have all announced promises or initiatives to combat disinformation ahead of the 2022 midterms, saying they were committed to protecting the election process. But the report said those measures were ineffective, haphazardly enforced or simply too limited.Facebook, for example, announced that it would ban ads that called into question the legitimacy of the coming elections, but it exempted politicians from its fact-checking program. That, the report says, allows candidates and other influential leaders to undermine confidence in the vote by questioning ballot procedures or other rules.In the case of Twitter, an internal report released as part of a whistle-blower’s complaint from a former head of security, Peiter Zatko, disclosed that the company’s site integrity team had only two experts on misinformation.The New York University report, which incorporated responses from all the companies except YouTube, called for greater transparency in how companies rank, recommend and remove content. It also said they should enhance fact-checking efforts and remove provably untrue claims, and not simply label them false or questionable.A spokeswoman for Twitter, Elizabeth Busby, said the company was undertaking a multifaceted approach to ensuring reliable information about elections. That includes efforts to “pre-bunk” false information and to “reduce the visibility of potentially misleading claims via labels.”In a statement, YouTube said it agreed with “many of the points” made in the report and had already carried out many of its recommendations.“We’ve already removed a number of videos related to the midterms for violating our policies,” the statement said, “and the most viewed and recommended videos and channels related to the election are from authoritative sources, including news channels.”TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.There are already signs that the integrity of the vote in November will be as contentious as it was in 2020, when President Donald J. Trump and some of his supporters refused to accept the outcome, falsely claiming widespread fraud.Inattention by social media companies in the interim has allowed what the report describes as a coordinated campaign to take root among conservatives claiming, again without evidence, that wholesale election fraud is bent on tipping elections to Democrats.“Election denialism,” the report said, “was evolving in 2021 from an obsession with the former president’s inability to accept defeat into a broader, if equally baseless, attack on the patriotism of all Democrats, as well as non-Trump-loving Republicans, and legions of election administrators, many of them career government employees.”</body>

	<title>Corrections: Sept. 20, 2022</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>An article on Monday about Republican nominees backed by Donald J. Trump who would not commit to accepting this year’s election results misstated the number of Republicans who ignored or declined to answer a question about accepting the November election results. It was six, not five.An article on Friday about President Biden’s plans to meet with the families of Brittney Griner and Paul N. Whelan referred imprecisely to the 2011 conviction of Viktor Bout. While Mr. Bout was convicted of conspiring to kill American citizens, officers and employees by agreeing to sell weapons to informants from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the weapons sale did not take place.An article on Saturday about feuds and possible legal troubles within Donald J. Trump’s legal team misstated a position once held by Eric Herschmann, a former White House lawyer. He was a prosecutor for New York State, not a federal prosecutor.An article on Saturday about TikTok becoming a popular search engine for young people misstated the amount of time each day Jayla Johnson said she spends watching TikTok videos. She estimated that she watches them for two hours a day, not 10.An article on Monday about the quandary Apple faces about what to do with its new Will Smith movie, “Emancipation,” which was filmed before Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards ceremony misstated the circumstances of a slave’s escape. The slave, known as “Whipped Peter,” joined the Union Army while still in the South. He did not escape to the North.An article on Thursday about the standup comedian Raanan Hershberg misquoted a part of his act. He returns to a refrain of “Wrong information beats zero information,” not “More information beats bad information.”An article on Sept. 12 about what to watch on television in the week ahead misidentified the character Nathan Fillion plays on “The Rookie: Feds.” He plays a Los Angeles police officer, not an F.B.I. agent.An obituary on Aug. 30 about Carl Croneberg, who helped write the first comprehensive dictionary of American Sign Language, misstated when he became deaf. He was deaf from the age of 12, not from birth. The obituary also misstated the name of the town in Sweden where he was born. It is Norrbarke, not Norrbacka. And it misstated part of his birth name, He was born Carl Gustaf Arvid Olof Croneberg, not Gustav.Errors are corrected during the press run whenever possible, so some errors noted here may not have appeared in all editions.To contact the newsroom regarding correction requests, please email nytnews@nytimes.com.

	<title>Life Is Hazardous for Urban Raptors. These Women Offer Hope.</title>
	<author>Jules Jacobs</author>
	<body>It’s quiet on the back roads of Boyds, Md., where a small compound studded with bird feeders breaks up the monotony of the surrounding cornfields.Suddenly, a souped-up Toyota Tacoma kicks up a cloud of dust as it pulls into view on a gravel path. It slows to a halt. A figure steps out of the truck: a woman with a glove covering one arm and a sleeve of hawk tattoos covering the other. Reaching into the passenger seat, she pulls out a box, one that seems to be fighting her back.This one, I knew, would be headed for the I.C.U.Nancy McDonald is a volunteer rescuer at the Owl Moon Raptor Center, an organization based in Boyds that helps rescue and rehabilitate injured raptors — including hawks, owls, eagles and ospreys — before returning them to the wild.The word “raptor” derives from the Latin verb “rapiō,” meaning “to seize.” All raptors have four characteristics: a hooked beak, sharp talons, keen eyesight and a carnivorous diet.In some respects, birds of prey that live among human populations have a fragile life cycle. The threats they face include rodenticides (pesticides that kill rodents), entanglement with fishing lines and wires, car strikes and collisions with windows.In other ways, though, the animals are incredibly adaptive.Peregrine falcons sometimes use high-rise buildings as their aeries; ospreys can occupy man-made platforms to raise their chicks; and committees of vultures sometimes take over dumpsters, said Ms. McDonald, a 62-year-old U.S. Army veteran who began as a rescue volunteer in 2017. (And yes, “committee” is one of the terms for a group of vultures.)I first learned about Ms. McDonald and the Owl Moon Raptor Center, whose primary operator is Suzanne Shoemaker, an expert in animal behavior and ecology, when I was a college student in Washington, D.C. Then an aspiring wildlife photographer, I assumed I’d have to travel to far-flung places in order to find subjects to photograph.And yet, on my way to and from classes, I would often see hawks soaring above the cityscape. Eventually I began to track the birds in between lectures, searching for signs of broken branches or the carcasses of their prey. Spending so much time looking for hints of the birds led me to wonder about the threats they faced and about those who worked to save them.When the pandemic hit in 2020, I moved back to my family home in the suburbs. But still intrigued by the birds, I posted a question in a local birding group on Facebook, and Ms. McDonald answered. She invited me to visit Owl Moon and learn about the threats that plague urban raptors.After my initial visit, I was hooked. For weeks I accompanied Ms. McDonald as she went about her work — on rescues, on hikes to the rehabilitation field, into the freezers to mince mice carcasses. We even shared a bottle of whiskey when a bird we both loved had to be humanely euthanized.Not all the work was uplifting. On one occasion, a red-tailed hawk named Kean was found to be sitting on top of and crushing other birds in the mew, a large birdhouse designed to hold several raptors. (After colliding with a high-rise in Baltimore, the bird was suffering from neurological and behavioral issues.) In the end, Kean’s condition exacerbated the injuries of other birds, limiting their chances to heal.It was a race against time. Ms. McDonald tried to find another home for the bird, calling other rehab centers that she thought might want the hawk as an ambassador bird, or a bird used for educational purposes with students and other visitors. But no one else had room for what some saw as “yet another red-tailed hawk.” (Many centers may have made room for a more exotic bird.)Having exhausted all other options, and understanding that the bird’s condition was too dangerous to the other releasable birds, the Owl Moon Raptor Center had no choice but to euthanize Kean.Euthanasia is an unfortunate reality of raptor rescues. In many instances, it is the only humane way forward after rodenticide poisonings or collisions with windows or cars. Still, for the anguished volunteers, each loss is painful.Of course, it’s the successes that drive the raptor rescuers forward. Ms. McDonald still remembers one of the first tasks she was given when she joined the organization: to release a rehabbed red-tailed hawk in Crofton, Md.“I opened the box and it hopped out,” she said. “The hawk just sat there for about 10 minutes, getting its bearings — and then, all of a sudden, it took off.” That was the first time she knew that she was part of something valuable, she said.I spent a good deal of my time at Owl Moon in and around the mew, where many of the hawks are held. The wooden floorboards creaked as I came and went, accompanied by the rustling of more than 20 birds of prey who were confined while being rehabilitated.I would watch and photograph as the rescuers carefully prepared for their daily rounds. They pulled on oversize Kevlar gloves and equipped themselves with 12-foot nets. Then they got ready to duck. There was a flurry of feathers as they entered the room with the birds, the newly admitted red-shouldered and red-tailed hawks scattering to the top of their enclosure.To those who work at Owl Moon, each bird’s journey is part of their own. Both the birds and their rehabbers yearn for the day the raptors can fly free. But in offering the birds another chance, the rescuers themselves gain something, too: lessons about resilience, adaptation and recovery.As a photographer, I learned something important from the birds, too — namely that profound conservation stories needn’t take me to the ends of the earth. They’re to be found all around us, in our cities and suburbs, if only we’re willing to look.Jules Jacobs is a conservation photographer based in San Diego.

	<title>Ukrainian officials try to build pressure to hold Russia accountable for war crimes.</title>
	<author>Juston Jones</author>
	<body>After its recent success in reclaiming territory in its northeast with a lightning offensive, Ukraine on Sunday tried to build support for holding Russia accountable for alleged war crimes.Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, and its ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, both spoke on Sunday on American television shows about what its troops were finding as they moved into towns after pushing the Russians out.Mr. Kostin said that his office was investigating thousands of cases of possible war crimes, and that the recently uncovered evidence of mass graves in the city of Izium, which had been occupied by the Russians for months, pointed to a pattern.“What we see now is, of course, the horrible amount of potential war crimes committed by Russian aggressor,” Mr. Kostin said in an interview on “Face the Nation” on CBS. He added, “And it seems that, for me, that whenever Russian Army comes, they turn this place into the new Bucha, as we see in Izium.”He was referring to the torture, rape and execution of civilians by Russian soldiers that The New York Times documented in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, and other cities around Ukraine in the spring, though the situation in the northeast is not identical.The investigators working in Ukraine to build cases for war crimes face immense challenges. Complicating their efforts is the fact that they are working while the war is still raging. The Kremlin has denied allegations against its forces, and its spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Monday that reports of Russian atrocities in Izium are “a lie,” Russia’s Interfax news agency reported.Ms. Markarova, the Ukrainian envoy to the United States, in an appearance on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, said that Ukrainian fighters had come across evidence of “tortures, rapes, killings, war crimes of massive proportions.” And President Biden referred to the actions by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over seven months of war as “barbaric.”“It has been barbaric what he has done,” he said in an interview with CBS that aired Sunday on “60 Minutes.”Mr. Biden also warned the Russian president not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, where Russian forces have been left reeling from their retreats on the battlefield. Some Western officials have expressed concern that a threatened Mr. Putin could lash out with an unconventional weapon.“Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II,” Mr. Biden said, an apparent reference to the American use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.“They’ll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been,” Mr. Biden said of the Russians. He warned that the response would be “consequential” and would depend “on the extent of what they do.”U.S. security officials appear more concerned than ever that Mr. Putin could escalate the war to compensate for his humiliating retreat from the northeastern Kharkiv region, after Ukraine gained more ground in a few days than Russia had in months.On Sunday, the top U.S. military official voiced his concerns.“The war is not going too well for Russia right now. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw after visiting a base hosting U.S. troops, according to Reuters. “In the conduct of war, you just don’t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.”President Volodymyr Zelensky will have a chance to make Ukraine’s case to world leaders this week when he addresses the United Nations General Assembly. The General Assembly voted on Friday to let him submit a pre-recorded speech to the gathering in New York, making an exception to its requirement that all leaders speak in person. His address is expected to be broadcast midweek.Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Judge Vacates Murder Conviction of Adnan Syed of ‘Serial’</title>
	<author>Michael Levenson</author>
	<body>In a remarkable reversal, Adnan Syed walked out of prison on Monday for the first time since he was a teenager, having spent 23 years fighting his conviction on charges that he murdered his former high school girlfriend, a case that was chronicled in the first season of the hit podcast “Serial.”Judge Melissa M. Phinn of Baltimore City Circuit Court vacated the conviction “in the interests of justice and fairness,” finding that prosecutors had failed to turn over evidence that could have helped Mr. Syed at trial and discovered new evidence that could have affected the outcome of his case.Prosecutors have 30 days to decide if they will proceed with a new trial or drop the charges against Mr. Syed, who was ordered to serve home detention until then. Prosecutors said that an investigation had pointed to two possible “alternative suspects,” although those individuals have not been named publicly or charged.“At this time, we will remove the shackles from Mr. Syed,” Judge Phinn declared after announcing her decision. Moments later, Mr. Syed walked onto the courthouse steps, smiling as a crowd of supporters shouted and cheered. He gave a small wave and climbed into a waiting SUV, without saying anything to reporters who pressed around him.Mr. Syed, 41, had been serving a life sentence after he was convicted of strangling his high school classmate and onetime girlfriend Hae Min Lee, whose body was found buried in a park in Baltimore in 1999.Mr. Syed, who was 17 at the time, had steadfastly maintained his innocence, and questions about whether he had received a fair trial drew widespread attention when “Serial” debuted in 2014. The podcast became a pop-culture sensation with its detailed examination over 12 episodes of the case against Mr. Syed, including the peculiarities of his lawyer, who agreed to be disbarred amid complaints of wrongdoing in 2001 and died in 2004.But it wasn’t until this month that prosecutors recommended that his conviction be vacated and that he be granted a new trial because, they said, “the state no longer has confidence in the integrity of the conviction.”In a motion filed in Baltimore City Circuit Court on Wednesday, prosecutors said that a nearly yearlong investigation, conducted with Mr. Syed’s lawyer, had uncovered information pointing to the possible involvement of two “alternative suspects,” as well as key evidence that prosecutors might have failed to disclose to Mr. Syed’s lawyers in violation of their legal duty.The investigation also identified “significant reliability issues regarding the most critical pieces of evidence” used to convict Mr. Syed, including cellphone tower data.Prosecutors said in the motion that they were not asserting that Mr. Syed was innocent. Marilyn J. Mosby, the state’s attorney for Baltimore City, said on Monday that prosecutors were waiting for a DNA analysis that could help determine whether Mr. Syed’s case would be dismissed or proceed to another trial.Becky Feldman, a prosecutor in Ms. Mosby’s office, said at the hearing that the investigation “acknowledged justice has been denied to Ms. Lee and her family by not assuring the correct assailant was brought to justice.”Ms. Lee’s family expressed concern that prosecutors had not given them adequate notice about the move to vacate the conviction. During the hearing Monday, Steve Kelly, the family’s lawyer, asked Judge Phinn to postpone a decision on the motion.But Judge Phinn rejected the request, and Ms. Lee’s brother, Young Lee, then joined the hearing on Zoom after Mr. Kelly called him at work.“This is not a podcast for me,” Mr. Lee said, voice wavering, when he addressed the court. “This is real life — a never-ending nightmare for 20-plus years.”He said he felt “betrayed” and “blindsided” by the motion to vacate, and frustrated with the many turns in the case over the last two decades. “Whenever I think it’s over, and it’s ended, it always comes back,” Mr. Lee said, adding: “It’s killing me and killing my mother.”Mr. Syed’s lawyer, Erica J. Suter, indicated that her client was stunned to have walked out of prison after spending more than half his life behind bars.“He said he can’t believe it’s real,” Ms. Suter said at a news conference. “Today is both joyful and incredibly overwhelming.”Ms. Mosby moved to vacate Mr. Syed’s conviction as she faces federal charges that she perjured herself to obtain money from a retirement fund and made false statements on loan applications to buy two vacation homes in Florida. That case is continuing. Her lawyer has called the charges “bogus.”Mr. Syed had an on-again, off-again relationship with Ms. Lee when they were both students at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County. Prosecutors had theorized that he killed her after she started dating someone else in December 1998.Key evidence implicating Mr. Syed came from a friend and co-defendant, Jay Wilds, who testified that he had helped Mr. Syed bury Ms. Lee’s body.Prosecutors also used cellphone billing records to corroborate Mr. Wilds’s testimony and to show that Mr. Syed had been in the area of the park where Ms. Lee, 18, was buried.A jury convicted Mr. Syed in 2000 of first-degree murder, robbery, kidnapping and false imprisonment. An appeals court vacated Mr. Syed’s conviction in 2018, ruling that he had received ineffective legal counsel, but Maryland’s highest court reversed that decision in 2019.Ms. Suter brought the case to Ms. Mosby’s office last year after Maryland adopted a law that allowed people convicted of crimes as juveniles to request that their sentences be modified after they had served 20 years in prison.As Ms. Mosby’s office considered the request, additional evidence emerged requiring prosecutors to conduct a more in-depth investigation, the office said.Significantly, the investigation identified the two “alternative suspects” who may have been involved together or separately and were “known persons at the time of the investigation” but were never ruled out, prosecutors said. Both had “motive and/or propensity to commit this crime,” they wrote.Prosecutors did not disclose their names, and close watchers of the case have been speculating about who they are and whether they were mentioned in “Serial” or the four-part HBO documentary “The Case Against Adnan Syed,” which debuted in 2019. (In 2020, The New York Times Company bought Serial Productions, the company behind the podcast.)Prosecutors said that a document they found in their trial file indicated that one of the people had threatened Ms. Lee in front of another person, saying he would make her “disappear” and “kill her.”Prosecutors also found another document in their trial file in which a different person relayed information that “can be viewed as a motive for that same suspect to harm the victim,” the motion stated.The evidence could have helped Mr. Syed at trial, but it was not in the defense’s files or in any of the pleadings that prosecutors produced for the defense, the motion stated.The apparent failure to turn over the files might have violated a landmark Supreme Court ruling from 1963, Brady v. Maryland, which obligates prosecutors to provide their adversaries with any evidence that could be construed as favorable to the accused, the motion stated.The prosecutors’ investigation found that one of the two “alternative suspects” had been convicted of attacking a woman in her vehicle, and that one had been convicted of engaging in serial rape and sexual assault. Ms. Mosby’s office also disclosed that Ms. Lee’s car had been found directly behind the house of a family member of one of the individuals.In the motion, prosecutors questioned the cellphone data used to place Mr. Syed near the burial site, citing a notice on the cellphone records specifically stating that billing locations for incoming calls “would not be considered reliable information for location.” Two experts they consulted agreed with that assessment.“Mr. Syed’s conviction rests on the evolving narrative of an incentivized, cooperating, 19-year-old co-defendant, propped up by inaccurate and misleading cellphone location data,” Ms. Suter wrote in a court motion on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Wilds. “This was so in 1999, when Mr. Syed was a 17-year-old child. It remains so today.”Adam Bednar contributed reporting from Baltimore.</body>

	<title>Strike Near Another Ukrainian Nuclear Plant Escalates Fears of Disaster</title>
	<author>Marc Santora</author>
	<body>KYIV, Ukraine — A powerful Russian missile exploded less than 900 feet from the reactors of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant early Monday, according to Ukrainian officials, a reminder that, despite battlefield setbacks, Russia can still threaten disaster at any of Ukraine’s four active nuclear plants.The strike on Monday landed near the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, some 160 miles west of another nuclear complex that has been a focus of global concern, the Zaporizhzhia plant, where the United Nations sent a team of experts to stabilize the situation this month.Unlike the Zaporizhzhia plant, which sits in an active battlefield, the South Ukraine site is far from the frontline fighting, and the strike on Monday appeared to illustrate Russia’s long reach, and the catastrophic potential of an attack on such a plant.Security camera footage showed a huge fireball lighting up the night sky over the site, and the shock wave blew out more than 100 windows at the South Ukraine plant. Energoatom, Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company, said the blast did extensive damage around a hydroelectric power station near the complex, forced the shutdown of one of the plant’s hydraulic units, and caused partial power outages in the area.The source of the explosion could not be independently confirmed, but the strike fit a long-established pattern of Russia attacking critical Ukrainian infrastructure, even when it poses a serious threat to civilians. Russia has battered the energy systems that Ukrainian civilians rely on with artillery, briefly set up a base in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, and has occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station, for months, steadily raising fears that an accident would ensue.The three reactors at the South Ukraine plant were operating normally, officials said, and the extent of the damage and the type of missile were still being investigated. Ukraine’s southern military command said in a statement that preliminary information pointed to an Iskander cruise missile, with a range of hundreds of miles — one of the weapons in Russia’s arsenal that can reach any corner of Ukraine.Before President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sent his forces streaming into Ukraine in February, nuclear plants produced more than half of Ukraine’s electricity, the second-highest share among European nations after France. That heavy reliance has raised fears about further energy disruptions during the winter, and about the threats to the nuclear plants around the country.“There is no other way to characterize this except for nuclear terrorism,” Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told Ukrainian national television on Monday. He said that although the heavily fortified concrete buildings that house nuclear reactors are built to withstand a plane crash, the blast from the overnight strike would have been powerful enough to have damaged the containment structures, had the missile struck closer.“A few hundred meters and we would have woken up in a completely different reality,” Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a statement.The most dangerous attack on a nuclear plant, experts say, may not be a direct strike on a well-protected reactor, but one that damages or destroys the far more vulnerable critical infrastructure, like the cooling system, that keeps the reactor running safely. Failure of the cooling system can lead to a meltdown and an enormous release of radiation.In the explosion on Monday, less than 70 miles north of the city of Mykolaiv, there was no damage to essential safety equipment and the plant remained fully operational, Energoatom said.The strike near the South Ukraine plant, Ukraine’s second-largest working nuclear station, follows months of concern over the larger Zaporizhzhia plant to the east. That complex has come under repeated shelling, with Russia and Ukraine trading accusations of responsibility. As conditions deteriorated last month, the United Nations sent a team of inspectors to the plant, calling for a demilitarized zone at the site.The situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russian soldiers occupy but Ukrainian engineers operate, appears to have stabilized in recent days, after the plant resumed receiving electricity from Ukraine’s power grid last week. But its six reactors have all been shut down as a safety measure, after Energoatom determined that it was too risky to keep them running with fighting nearby.Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine had 15 working reactors at four nuclear plants, built primarily in the 1970s and 1980s, under the Soviet Union: the South Ukraine and Zaporizhzhia plants, in the south, and the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne plants, in the west. The Chernobyl plant in the north, the site of the 1986 nuclear accident, is defunct but engineers still safeguard the waste there — even through a weekslong occupation by Russian soldiers this spring.As the Kremlin’s campaign to seize territory has faltered, stalling in the east and suffering a rout in the north, Russia has frequently shelled essential Ukrainian infrastructure, including power plants, water treatment centers, railways and utilities. After a Ukrainian counteroffensive drove Russian forces out of the northern Kharkiv region just over a week ago, Russia launched missile strikes on a major heat and power plant in the area, briefly plunging it into a blackout.The Russian government has denied deliberately targeting civilian centers, despite the devastation of Mariupol, in Ukraine’s south, and extensive damage to other cities and towns, and its history of attacking civilians in Syria and Chechnya. The Kremlin made no statement on Monday about the attack on the South Ukraine plant.The strikes fit a pattern, analysts say, of sieges that sever lines of power, clean water, food supplies and communication. In combination with its shelling of thermal power plants, its seizure of a hydroelectric plant, and dozens of strikes on power lines and electrical substations, “Russia’s willful recklessness at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant appears part of a broader strategy to cut Ukraine off from energy sources,” Suriya Jayanti, a fellow at the Atlantic Council, wrote in a report last week.Ukrainian officials have said they can still produce enough energy to meet the nation’s needs this winter, but damage to infrastructure in towns and cities will make it difficult to transmit electricity to hundreds of thousands of consumers.Ukrainian officials have urged those living in territory recently reclaimed by Ukrainian forces, and in other parts of the country hit hard by fighting, to evacuate and not to return home until the fighting is over.And for the estimated 1.2 million people living in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces, access to electricity is unclear. In some places, heating, water and power infrastructure have been destroyed or badly damaged. Blackouts are frequently reported in parts of occupied southern Ukraine.President Volodymyr Zelensky said Moscow’s strikes on energy infrastructure were intended to make Ukrainians suffer as temperatures drop, and to keep the government in Kyiv from exporting energy to other parts of Europe, where sanctions against Russian energy have contributed to soaring gas and electricity bills for consumers and businesses.“Russia is trying to prevent us from using Ukraine’s capabilities to stabilize the situation in Europe,” Mr. Zelensky said last week. “Our ability to export electricity is something that Russia is very afraid of right now. Because we can foil Russian plans to squeeze every penny out of ordinary European citizens this winter as energy prices are expected to skyrocket.”Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for the Ukrainian military’s intelligence agency, said recently that nuclear power was essential to Ukraine’s energy production, and that Russia would therefore be planning further attacks, raising the risk of nuclear accidents.“The Russian invaders consistently and systematically shell the whole energy infrastructure of Ukraine, and this definitely may eventually involve other nuclear facilities, other nuclear power plants,” he said.Reporting was contributed by Anastasia Kuznietsova from Kyiv, Ukraine and Alan Yuhas from New York.</body>

	<title>The Choreography of Public Mourning</title>
	<author>Roslyn Sulcas</author>
	<body>The death of Queen Elizabeth II has been remarkable for many things: The outpouring of love and affection from her citizens and across the globe; the 20-hour, through-the-night queue to shuffle slowly past her coffin as it lay in state; the virtual cessation in Britain of reporting on any other news.But there has been another remarkable feature of the last 10 days, culminating in Monday’s funeral: the choreography.From the moment a palace official placed a discreet death notice with precision on the railings of Buckingham Palace to the Lord Chamberlain breaking his wand of office over the coffin in the final moments of the interment ceremony on Monday afternoon, every public event around the queen’s death has unfolded with an astonishing amount of formal, choreographed movement.The funeral has been planned for decades, and regularly rehearsed by the military contingents who take part. A smooth unrolling of procedures and, of course, some pomp and ceremony, seemed perfectly predictable.But it was striking how much the ceremonial ritual leading up to and including the funeral brought to mind an elaborate ballet — the kind with gorgeous, impractical costumes full of gilt and brocade, breeches, cockades and helmets (some with swan plumes!).Like the classic 19th-century ballets that display massed ranks of identically costumed, identically moving dancers, the rituals have shown us many military units from Britain and the Commonwealth moving with the kind of as-one-being synchronicity that is the dream of ballet directors the world over.The sense of formalized choreography began at the vigil over the queen’s body, which was brought on Wednesday to lie in state for several days at Westminster Hall. As the guards took up their positions around the catafalque on which the coffin lay, they stood with one foot forward, hands placed precisely on a staff, heads bent down at the same angle.When the Queen’s four children came to stand vigil, they waited for three loud strikes of a staff on the ground, then marched in perfect diamond formation toward the catafalque before taking up positions around it. Three more taps, and they stepped up to the coffin in unison. Another three strikes, and they turned outward to the public folding their hands before them and bowing their heads.It was astonishingly polished, like well-rehearsed dancers who instinctively fall into step with one another.Then came the funeral. The whip-sharp turns of entire military units, moving from front to side as a command rang out; the tiny, calibrated steps of the 142 naval ratings (as these men and women are called) as they moved in from each side around the coffin, elevated on the gun carriage; the way the two men leading the Bearers of the Queen’s Company removed a guard rail and carefully lifted the royal standard cloth with perfectly coordinated gestures; a choreography of the mundane elevated to solemn ritual.And then there were the eight bearers — the brilliant soloists of the pageant. Several times during the ceremony they had to lift the draped coffin — with a wreath of flowers, a jeweled orb and the state crown perched on top — carry it and then place it down, on the gun carriage, the catafalque and, finally, into the royal hearse.Each time, they had to face the coffin, lifting it with two hands and betraying no strain (just like dancers), then on command, raise it high into the air, before turning sharply inward so that it rested on their shoulders. After a number of steps forward, they turned again as one to the side and seamlessly conveyed the coffin onto the carriage or the catafalque with nary a bump or tremor.Between these ritualized moments were marches — first a short one from Westminster Hall to the Abbey, where the funeral took place, then a longer march after the ceremony to Wellington Arch, involving thousands of military personnel on foot and on horseback, as well as the queen’s family and household. All (even the horses) moved in perfect unison at 75 steps a minute, to music played by a band that also moved in perfect unison, even when rounding corners and going through gates and arches.Like a huge corps de ballet, individuals disappeared into geometric patterns as their lines fanned out and came back together, and like dancers responding to the music, they seemed to stop and start their movement through an invisible connection to one another.But the ceremony wasn’t just notable for the remarkable precision and timing of its participants. It was also notable for its use of stillness and silence; the absolute immobility required at various points from the thousands of troops, and from the members of the royal family marching behind the coffin. The intentional discipline of these moments, before the dramatic striking of a staff, the command of an officer or the start of “God Save the King,” were as theatrical and emotionally powerful as any great stage performance.Movement has meaning. But just as we may not understand the gestural intention of a dancer’s mime in a ballet, we don’t have to comprehend the meanings of every formalized twirl of a baton, reversal of a rifle, or hierarchy of a formation to feel the comforting accrual of tradition and history that inform them.In these ceremonies and rituals there was an elaborate, physically specific choreography of mourning that embodied both loss and permanence, sadness and the reassurance of continuity. It was, as a television commentator put it, “the noble pageantry of death.”</body>

	<title>To Ease the Climate Crisis, First Figure Out What Works</title>
	<author>Peter Wilson</author>
	<body>This article is part of Climate Solutions, a special report on efforts to make a difference, coinciding with The New York Times Climate Forward conference and Climate Week NYC.For Esther Duflo, a worrying sign of how wealthy nations will manage the climate crisis and its impact on poor countries was evident in how the world reacted to the Covid-19 pandemic.“With Covid, the pressure on rich countries was that if we don’t vaccinate in India, it’s going to come back to hurt us,” said Ms. Duflo, a leading development economist, in a recent video interview. “And even then we were not able to do it.” The global vaccine rollout has left her increasingly pessimistic about the likelihood of global cooperation on climate, she said.Dr. Duflo, 49, has spent her life studying the impact of economic and social policies on the poor. Born in France, she became the youngest winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 2019. She co-founded and is co-director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab at M.I.T, which coordinates the work of 700 to 1,000 researchers around the world.She has been pivotal in promoting the use of randomized control trials to identify development policies and programs that work, and she supports a similar approach for climate change initiatives.Dr. Duflo will be speaking at The New York Times Climate Forward conference on Tuesday about the connection between inequality and climate change.She talked about why inequality can make fighting climate change “a political problem from hell.”This conversation was edited and condensed.What impact will climate change have on global inequality?The responsibility for the emissions that lead to climate change rests mainly with rich countries and their consumers, but the cost is mainly going to be borne by citizens in poor countries. I think climate change could actually undo a significant part of the progress we’ve made over the last 30 years in reducing extreme poverty. In the poorer countries and in some places it is going to be absolutely dramatic. We have already seen the flooding in Pakistan, Bangladesh will find itself under water and a part of India might become impossible to cultivate.Has the global response to the pandemic left you less confident about rich and poor nations pulling together to respond to climate change?Relinquishing a fortune. Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor apparel maker Patagonia, transferred ownership of his company to a trust and an organization devoted to fighting climate change. The move comes at a moment of growing scrutiny for billionaires whose rhetoric about making the world a better place often don’t match reality.High stakes. A new scientific assessment suggests that failure to limit global warming to the targets set by international accords will most likely set off several climate “tipping points,” thresholds passed which effects of climate change, from the thawing of Arctic permafrost to the loss of coral reefs, would probably become irreversible.Melting ice. In a more drastic forecast than earlier assessments, a new study found that the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could eventually raise global sea levels by at least 10 inches. The study reached the conclusion in part because it used a different measure to gauge ice loss that takes into account the warming that has already occurred.Forever chemicals. Scientists have found a cheap, effective way to destroy so-called forever chemicals, a group of compounds that pose a global threat to human health. The Environmental Protection Agency said it will designate the two most commonly detected chemicals, which have been linked to cancer and have been found in everything from drinking water to furniture, as hazardous substances.It has left me less confident, because it seemed to me that Covid was a relatively simple issue to tackle and we failed the test. Rich countries could have agreed on a financial package for the poor nations, so they could help their citizens. But it didn’t happen, so the rich nations spent about 24 percent of their G.D.P. [gross domestic product] in fiscal stimulus measures but the poor nations only had 2 percent to spend. It would have been a drop in the bucket for the rich countries to help the poor nations spend the same proportion of G.D.P. because their G.D.P.s are much smaller.The second thing that didn’t happen was the fast distribution of vaccines around the world. Instead the rich countries bought all the doses for themselves. So what are the chances of success when you think of something as complicated as climate change, which involves new ways of production, technology transfers, solutions that need to be invented, and a longer time horizon? With climate change it is not as obvious to people in the rich countries that by helping the poor countries we are helping ourselves. That makes it even harder to act so I think that makes it a political problem from hell.Many believe there is an inherent conflict between the goals of fighting climate change and promoting development, as economic growth has traditionally meant greater consumption and higher carbon emissions. Do you see it that way?I think that there is some tension, particularly if developing countries want to emulate exactly the model that we followed. India, for example, sees it as their right to use coal if they want to use coal, and that’s going to increase emissions. But one thing that ameliorates this tension is India’s concern for its own quality of life because CO2 emissions cause other pollution problems that kill people. That can help to sell the argument that it is better to grow in a way that maintains relatively cleaner air and fewer emissions.Your approach of using randomized control trials to test the effectiveness of development initiatives is now widely accepted. Given the urgency of the climate crisis do we have time for this approach? Well, what’s the alternative? It is to do all sorts of stuff that doesn’t work. For example, one response that France has for climate change is to weatherize houses [for instance, with better insulation]. But there was a study done in the U.S. about government weatherization programs that showed that it basically doesn’t produce any impact. So before spending all of your climate budget to insulate homes, you might want to know whether that is going to work or not.When I started working on randomized evaluation in poverty 25 years ago, people said, “Oh, we have no time, we have to move forward.” But how much time have we wasted by spending money on stuff that doesn’t work? It’s the same with climate.In all the research you’ve seen on the intersection of climate change and development, has there been anything that has really surprised you?What keeps coming up, and I think should really surprise and worry people, is the gap between engineering estimates of how promising a technology is for mitigation and how well it actually works in practice. And those gaps are really enormous. Unfortunately, most carbon credits [permits allowing the emission of greenhouse gases] are sold or distributed on the basis of engineering estimates, not estimates based on real-life evidence. And those mitigation estimates are usually way off and much, much too optimistic. Is there enough attention being paid to reducing the impact of climate change on poorer citizens of developed nations?One big error, I think, in our thinking about climate has been to dissociate the effort to reduce climate change and the effort to reduce inequality. The two are intimately connected, because the more you consume, the more you emit and it is with the very rich that the very big declines in emissions could take place. But the two have been disconnected and therefore there has often been a conflict perceived between the two.So how can governments convince lower income earners that climate action will not be at their expense?That’s the rhetorical fight that has to be fought. I think the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed in the U.S. goes a long way in that direction by taking the emphasis off carbon tax, which people see as basically a way of taxing gasoline and therefore their way of life. And moving instead to investments in renewables, in infrastructure, in public transport, which create jobs while helping people move toward a lifestyle that’s more respectful of the planet.What is the impact of the belief that technology will save us so we don’t have to tell voters that they need to make uncomfortable changes?The bad news is that we will need an adjustment of behavior. The good news is that adjusting behavior is not that hard. People are creatures of habit, and when they start new habits they will get used to it. We can change and it doesn’t have to be painful.</body>

	<title>With a Playoff Spot in Reach, the Mets Control Their Destiny</title>
	<author>Jesus Jiménez</author>
	<body>Atop the National League East with a record of 93-55, the Mets are closing in on a playoff spot. With 14 games left in the regular season, the only real question left is whether they will enter the postseason with a division title — and possibly a first-round bye — or a wild-card spot.In a tradition as old as the franchise, the Mets gave their fans reason to believe that their grip on the division was in jeopardy last week by way of a sweep at home by the rebuilding Chicago Cubs — the first time the Mets had been swept in a three-game series this season. Those doubts faded quickly, however, when the Mets woke up and completed a four-game sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates, winning the series finale on Sunday, 7-3.“It’s really hard to beat a major league team four times,” Manager Buck Showalter said. “Every team is a little weary of this time of year — mentally emotionally, physically — you got to keep going, keep going, knowing there’s a pot of gold down the road.”In some ways, Sunday’s win was emblematic of what it takes to make a deep run in the playoffs. A solid — but short — outing from a starter, quality innings from the bullpen, a productive offense, aggressiveness on the basepaths and late-inning theatrics.Striking out 20 batters without allowing a walk helped as well.After giving up a leadoff double to shortstop Oneil Cruz in the first, Jacob deGrom set the tone for the day quickly by striking out the next three batters he faced. He lacked some efficiency, and allowed a three-run homer to Cruz in the sixth that ended his day. But he still came away with a season-high 13 strikeouts.That kept up as the game went along. Seth Lugo was the first out of the bullpen, striking out one in the sixth. Joely Rodríguez struck out five over two innings, and Trevor May closed things out with one in the ninth. That made the Mets the ninth team in major league history to strike out 20 in a nine-inning gameShowalter said he was more proud of his pitchers for not giving up any walks than he was for the huge number of strikeouts.“That’s hard to do in today’s game when people are chasing walks in a lot of cases,” Showalter said.Despite the power pitching, the game was tied, 3-3, in the eighth inning when the Mets found a rally thanks to a newcomer. Catcher Tomás Nido singled and was removed for a pinch-runner, Terrance Gore. After three pickoff attempts from Pirates reliever Manny Bañuelos, Gore stole second, then advanced to third after a throwing error by catcher Jason Delay. Brandon Nimmo singled to bring in Gore and give the Mets a 4-3 lead.The Mets added three more insurance runs, but Gore made his presence known, and was credited by Showalter after the game for being “a student of baserunning.”Gore, a pinch-running specialist who was called up from Class AAA this month, said he would often study video for an hour before a game to have an advantage on the basepaths.“I take a lot of pride in it,” Gore said. “I try to make it my perfection and just take pride in what I do.”The Mets now head to Milwaukee for a three-game series against the Brewers, and they could clinch the playoffs as soon as early this week. But the Atlanta Braves, who swept the Philadelphia Phillies over the weekend, have stayed right behind the Mets, trailing by one game in the N.L. East.The Mets will finish out the regular season mostly on the road, with only five remaining games at home. Their most crucial series, in fact, will come in Atlanta, starting Sept. 30, and that three-game set could effectively decide the division. Thanks to baseball’s new playoff format, the team that finishes on top might skip the wild-card round entirely, as the top two division winners in each league advance directly to a division series.Showalter said his players are hungry and ready to clinch a spot in the playoffs, but that nothing is decided yet.“You earn everything in this game, and our guys continue to earn it daily,” he said.Helping matters is the expected return of Max Scherzer, who is scheduled to start for the Mets on Monday night. He had been placed on the 15-day injured list earlier this month after he exited a start with left-side fatigue.After the game on Sunday, Scherzer was relaxed in the Mets clubhouse, as were the rest of the Mets, with some playing billiards and others, including deGrom, table tennis.In between games, deGrom told reporters that the sweep against Pittsburgh was “big for us,” especially after being swept against Chicago. But he said the team never lost faith.“I wouldn’t say there’s been a big mood shift,” deGrom said. “This group does a good job of coming in the same way every day, and the goal is to win baseball games.”</body>

	<title>McDonald’s Begins to Reopen Restaurants in Ukraine This Week</title>
	<author>Isabella Simonetti</author>
	<body>Three McDonald’s restaurants will reopen in Kyiv this week, a company spokeswoman said on Monday, fulfilling a pledge the chain made last month to bring employees back to work even as the war persists.On Tuesday, the restaurants in Kyiv will open exclusively for delivery, Alesya Mudzhyri, McDonald’s head of communications in Ukraine, wrote in a Facebook post, with expanded safety protocols to keep employees safe. All 109 McDonald’s restaurants in Ukraine closed after Russia invaded in February.McDonald’s is carrying through with its commitment to restore “a small but important sense of normalcy,” which it first expressed in August when the fast-food franchise shared plans to open the restaurants. At the time, Paul Pomroy, a vice president for international operations, said employees had expressed a “strong desire” to return to work after many fled the country and others joined the military. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Over the next two months, McDonald’s restaurants in Kyiv and western Ukraine will reopen. In October, restaurants that reopen will be able to host customers in person and via drive-through windows, Ms. Mudzhyri’s post said. The restaurants are set to open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. but will close during air raid alerts to give employees and customers time to go to nearby shelters.McDonald’s has 39,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries. In Russia, where it had 840 restaurants, the company stopped operating after the invasion and put the franchise up for sale. The Russian restaurants were purchased by a Siberian oil mogul and reopened in June under a different name.</body>

	<title>Lesson Plan: The Debate Over the Teaching of U.S. History</title>
	<author>Jeremy Engle</author>
	<body>Featured Article: “What’s Actually Being Taught in History Class”Schools across the country are caught up in debates over what students should learn about U.S. history. In the last two years, dozens of state legislatures have introduced bills that would limit what teachers can say about complicated subjects like race, gender and inequality. In this interactive piece, The Times talked to social studies teachers about what they teach and why.Have you been following the debate over history? Has it affected your school or teachers?In this lesson, you will hear from teachers around the country and explore the challenges and rewards of teaching history today. In the Going Further section, we invite you to interview a teacher or a student about the experience of teaching and learning about history.Before reading the featured article, take a few moments to reflect on your experiences of the subject of history — in and out of school. Then, respond in writing or in discussion with a partner, using the following prompts as a guide.Describe your experiences with history — in and out of school: Do you like history? Do you find stories of the past to be fascinating, fun or meaningful? Or are you mostly turned off or bored by the subject?How important is it for young people to learn about the past? What difference would it make to society if people didn’t know what happened before they were born?Do you have a favorite historical figure, event, topic or time period?Do you think your teachers have done a good job in teaching you history over the years? Have any of your teachers ever made the past come alive? If so, describe how.Read the article and then answer the following questions:1. What is your reaction to the videos of social studies teachers around the United States? What did you learn about the challenges and rewards of being a history teacher today? Which teacher or quote stands out and why?2. How do your own experiences in history classes that you wrote about in the warm-up activity compare to those described by the teachers in the interactive? Which teacher responses resonate most with your own experiences as a student?3. Why is the teaching of U.S. history at the center of a larger debate over politics in public school education, according to the article? How is critical race theory, or C.R.T., connected to these debates?4. Karalee Wong Nakatsuka, a teacher from Arcadia, Calif., says, “It’s the job of a history teacher to tell the full and complex story of U.S. history.” What does that mean to you? Do you think you have learned the “full and complex story” of U.S. history? If not, what do you think has been missing?5. The Times asked the teachers how they approach and discuss hot-button historical topics and figures, such as slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jefferson and Lincoln. Which answers stood out to you and why? Were any of the approaches similar to or different from your own experiences with that subject matter?6. The featured teachers said they try to bring history to life using a variety of means, such as primary sources, personal stories and family documents. Have any teachers used these methods in your own classes? If so, how effective have they been? What advice would you give teachers to make history more engaging, accurate and meaningful?7. What are your three biggest takeaways from the article? How does reading the article change your understanding of history and the current debate about its teaching? What perspectives, if any, are missing from the Times interactive? How would these voices deepen or further the conversation?Option 1: Consider the purpose of history education.At the center of the debate about the teaching of history are these questions: What should be the purpose of teaching U.S. history in schools? And what concepts and facts should be included in history courses, and what should be left out? If you would like to join a conversation with other students around the world about these questions, share your thoughts in our related writing prompt.Option 2: Interview a teacher or student about the experience of teaching or learning U.S. history.Interview a teacher or student at your own school and find out that person’s experiences and thoughts about U.S. history education. Here are a few possible questions you might include in your interview:How do you (or your teachers) bring history to life?Why is it important for young people to learn about the U.S. history?What is it like to teach — or learn — about the role that race and racism have played in U.S. history?During your interview, be sure to record your conversation or take good notes. For more interviewing tips, watch the five-minute video “Four Tips for an Effective Interview” by StoryCorps or read “Interview Tips Sheet” by What Kids Can Do.Then share the big ideas and takeaways from your interview with your classmates.

	<title>California Woman Who Faked Her Own Abduction Gets 18 Months in Prison</title>
	<author>Eduardo Medina</author>
	<body>A California woman who faked her own kidnapping in 2016 and fabricated an elaborate tale to tell the authorities, prompting an extensive and costly search for made-up perpetrators, was sentenced on Monday to 18 months in prison, the Justice Department said.The woman, Sherri Papini, 40, of Redding, Calif., pleaded guilty in April to one count of making false statements to F.B.I. agents about her disappearance and one count of mail fraud.Federal prosecutors said that “not only did Papini lie to law enforcement, her friends and her family, she also made false statements to the California Victim Compensation Board and the Social Security Administration” to collect more than $125,000 in disability benefits.As part of the sentence, Judge William B. Shubb of U.S. District Court in Sacramento ordered Ms. Papini to pay $309,902 in restitution for losses incurred by several agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Her lawyer, William Portanova, said on Monday that Ms. Papini regretted her actions.He added that even though federal prosecutors had recommended she serve only eight months in prison, he still believed that the sentence handed down by Judge Shubb was just.“We feel Ms. Papini was treated very fairly by the U.S. attorney and by the court, and she knows she has to pay her price,” Mr. Portanova said, adding, “Sometimes it takes a crash to change your life.”Judge Shubb said during the hearing that Ms. Papini was a “manipulator” who had lied to scores of people, including the authorities and her friends and family, The Sacramento Bee reported.“We have to send a message that crime doesn’t pay,” Judge Shubb said.On Nov. 2, 2016, Ms. Papini’s husband, Keith, came home from work and reported his wife missing after finding that she had not returned from a jog and that their children had not been picked up from day care, according to a criminal complaint.He had used the Find My iPhone app to locate her phone about a mile from their home, he told investigators. Ms. Papini’s disappearance prompted a three-week search across Northern California and several other states. It also elicited an emotional public plea from Mr. Papini, who said through tears: “Bring her home safe. There’s a $50,000 reward.”On Nov. 24, 2016, a truck driver spotted Ms. Papini along an interstate in Yolo County, more than 140 miles south of where she had disappeared, the U.S. attorney’s office said. She had “various bindings on her body” and injuries that included a “brand” on her right shoulder, according to prosecutors.Ms. Papini told the authorities that she had been abducted by two Hispanic women who had tied her to a pole inside a closet and given her a bucket of cat litter to use as a toilet. She said that the women had beaten her and that she was branded after she tried to escape.For more than four years, Ms. Papini “repeated her false story about her kidnapping, while law enforcement continued its investigation to identify Papini’s kidnappers,” the Justice Department said. Detectives continued their questioning. More money was poured into the case. But the authorities, who felt that something was amiss with her recollection, eventually learned the truth: She had lied to law enforcement and loved ones “in order to receive benefits as a result of her alleged ‘post-traumatic stress’ from being abducted,” the Justice Department said.More details began to emerge as investigators further examined her narrative. She had inflicted bruises on herself to support her story, prosecutors said. And after DNA taken from her shirt was traced to an ex-boyfriend, the authorities learned that she had stayed with him in Southern California during her disappearance, and that she had used prepaid cellphones to arrange for him to take her to his home about 600 miles away, the authorities said.Investigators said that the ex-boyfriend told them that Ms. Papini had instructed him to brand her with a tool for making crafts.In August 2020, the authorities questioned Ms. Papini about her abduction claim, warning her that it was unlawful to lie to federal agents. She was eventually arrested in March 2022.Mr. Portanova, Ms. Papini’s lawyer, said that his client was committed to “changing her life in a major way.”“It’s a little bit overwhelming for anybody to go through this experience,” he said, “even if it’s your own fault.”</body>

	<title>YouTube’s Dislike Button Rarely Shifts Recommendations, Researchers Say</title>
	<author>Nico Grant</author>
	<body>For YouTube viewers dissatisfied with the videos the platform has recommended to them, pressing the “dislike” button may not make a big difference, according to a new research report.YouTube has said users have numerous ways to indicate that they disapprove of content and do not want to watch similar videos. But all of those controls are relatively ineffective, researchers at the Mozilla Foundation said in a report published on Tuesday. The result was that users continued receiving unwanted recommendations on YouTube, the world’s largest video site.Researchers found that YouTube’s “dislike” button reduced similar, unwanted recommendations only 12 percent, according to their report, titled “Does This Button Work?” Pressing “Don’t recommend channel” was 43 percent effective in reducing unwanted recommendations, pressing “not interested” was 11 percent effective and removing a video from one’s watch history was 29 percent effective.The researchers analyzed more than 567 million YouTube video recommendations with the help of 22,700 participants. They used a tool, RegretReporter, that Mozilla developed to study YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. It collected data on participants’ experiences on the platform. But the participants were not representative of all YouTube users because they voluntarily downloaded the tool.Jesse McCrosky, one of the researchers who conducted the study, said YouTube should be more transparent and give users more influence over what they see.“Maybe we should actually respect human autonomy and dignity here, and listen to what people are telling us, instead of just stuffing down their throat whatever we think they’re going to eat,” Mr. McCrosky said in an interview.YouTube defended its recommendation system. “Our controls do not filter out entire topics or viewpoints, as this could have negative effects for viewers, like creating echo chambers,” Elena Hernandez, a spokeswoman for YouTube, said in a statement. “Mozilla’s report doesn’t take into account how our systems actually work, and therefore it’s difficult for us to glean many insights.”YouTube also said its own surveys had shown that users were generally satisfied with the recommendations they saw, and that the platform has tried to not prevent recommendations of all content related to a topic, opinion or speaker. The company also said it was looking to collaborate with more academic researchers under its researcher program.One research participant asked YouTube on Jan. 17 not to recommend content like a video about a cow trembling in pain, which included an image of a discolored hoof. On March 15, the user received a recommendation for a video titled “There Was Pressure Building in This Hoof,” which again included a graphic image of the end of a cow’s leg. Other examples of unwanted recommendations included videos of guns, violence from the war in Ukraine and Tucker Carlson’s show on Fox News.The researchers also detailed an episode of a YouTube user expressing disapproval of a video called “A Grandma Ate Cookie Dough for Lunch Every Week. This Is What Happened to Her Bones.” For the next three months, the user continued seeing recommendations for similar videos about what happened to people’s stomachs, livers and kidneys after they consumed various items.“Eventually, it always comes back,” one user said.Ever since it developed a recommendation system, YouTube has shown each user a personalized version of the platform that surfaces videos its algorithms determine viewers want to see based on past viewing behavior and other variables. The site has been scrutinized for sending people down rabbit holes of misinformation and political extremism.In July 2021, Mozilla published research that found that YouTube had recommended 71 percent of the videos that participants had said featured misinformation, hate speech and other unsavory content.YouTube has said its recommendation system relies on numerous “signals” and is constantly evolving, so providing transparency about how it works is not as easy as “listing a formula.”“A number of signals build on each other to help inform our system about what you find satisfying: clicks, watch time, survey responses, sharing, likes and dislikes,” Cristos Goodrow, a vice president of engineering at YouTube, wrote in a corporate blog post last September.</body>

	<title>Russia is struggling to attract new recruits for its army, a U.S. official says.</title>
	<author>John Ismay</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Russia is struggling to attract recruits for its army amid its setbacks in Ukraine, while the United States is open to potentially sending Western tanks to Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday.“The Russians are performing so poorly that the news from Kharkiv Province has inspired many Russian volunteers to refuse combat,” the official said, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the status of Russia’s war in Ukraine, adding that the leader of the Wagner Group, a private military company with ties to the Kremlin, had been seen in videos posted on social media asking Russian prisoners, Tajiks, Belarusians and Armenians to join the fight in Ukraine.“We believe this is part of Wagner’s campaign to recruit over 1,500 convicted felons,” the official said. “But many are refusing.”Last week, a video posted online and analyzed by The New York Times showed the Wagner Group promising convicts that they would be released from prison in return for a six-month combat tour in Ukraine. It is unclear when the video was filmed.The official added that Russia was failing in its own strategic objectives, noting that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia reiterated last week that the “main goal” of his invasion was limited to capturing the Donbas — the eastern Ukrainian region where Russia has recognized as independent two Kremlin-backed statelets but where Ukraine still controls several key cities and towns. And, at a regional summit in Uzbekistan on Friday, Mr. Putin said Russia was committed to its “special military operation,” despite Russian losses in the northeast and Ukraine’s offensive in the south, near the port city of Kherson.Furthermore, Ukrainian forces now control all of their territory west of the Oskil River in eastern Ukraine, the official said, and have liberated more than 300 settlements in Kharkiv Province.With Ukrainian troops continuing to take back territory from Russian forces, and the war nearly seven months old, the Pentagon is discussing how best to support Kyiv for a long-term war. Part of that, the official said, includes transitioning Ukraine away from their Soviet-era weaponry and replacing them with those used by NATO and other Western militaries.While the United States and other nations have provided Ukraine with Soviet-era tanks, the Pentagon signaled an openness to transferring Western main battle tanks to Kyiv as well.“Armor is a really important capability area for the Ukrainians,” the official said. “We recognize that there will be a day when they may want to transition — and may need to transition — to NATO-compatible models.”President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked Western allies for more equipment and ammunition, saying the counteroffensive underway is dependent on getting more. He alluded to the need to speed up aid deliveries in his nightly address on Monday.“Pace is very important now,” Mr. Zelensky said. “We speak about this honestly. The pace of providing aid to Ukraine should correspond to the pace of our movement.”And despite its problems with manpower and organization, Russia still has a significant advantage over Ukraine in supplies and ammunition.“Tanks are absolutely on the table along with other areas,” said the American defense official. “We’re looking at the entirety of the Ukrainian armed forces and considering for the future what capabilities they will need and how the U.S. and our allies will be able to support Ukraine in building out those capabilities.”“In terms of the immediate fight, the tanks that are available that could be provided very quickly with little to no training are Soviet-type tanks, but we are certainly open to other options provided that the training, maintenance and the sustainment can be taken care of.”</body>

	<title>Chris Redd Is Latest Cast Member to Leave ‘S.N.L.’</title>
	<author>Dave Itzkoff</author>
	<body>The number of departing “Saturday Night Live” cast members has now risen to eight: Chris Redd, who has been with “S.N.L.” since fall 2017 and has played characters including Kanye West and Mayor Eric Adams of New York, will not be returning this season, NBC said on Monday night.Redd said in a statement: “Being a part of ‘S.N.L’ has been the experience of a lifetime. Five years ago, I walked into 30 Rock knowing that this was an amazing opportunity for growth. Now, with friends who have become family and memories I will cherish forever, I’m grateful to Lorne Michaels and to the entire ‘S.N.L.’ organization. From the bottom of my heart, I can’t thank you all enough.”Redd has also co-starred in the NBC sitcom “Kenan,” with the longtime “S.N.L.” cast member Kenan Thompson; in the Peacock comedy series “Bust Down”; and in movies like “Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.” His standup special “Chris Redd: Why Am I Like This?” will be released on HBO Max later this year, NBC said. Redd is one of several “S.N.L.” veterans who have exited the show ahead of its coming 48th season. Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Pete Davidson and Kyle Mooney all left “S.N.L.” at the conclusion of its 47th season in May. Earlier this month, Melissa Villaseñor, Alex Moffat and Aristotle Athari also departed the cast.Last week, NBC announced that “S.N.L.” had hired four new cast members. Those performers — Marcello Hernandez, Molly Kearney, Michael Longfellow and Devon Walker — will all begin as featured players when the new season begins on Oct. 1.</body>

	<title>U.S. Hostage Exchanged for Afghan Drug Lord in Prisoner Swap</title>
	<author>Christina Goldbaum</author>
	<body>KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban government of Afghanistan on Monday said that it had freed an American engineer, Mark R. Frerichs, in exchange for the release by the United States of a prominent Afghan tribal leader who had been convicted of drug trafficking.The release of the tribal leader, Haji Bashir Noorzai, who has close ties to the Taliban, was hailed by supporters of the group as a major symbolic victory and a public sign of the Taliban’s enduring loyalty to its supporters.During a news conference in Kabul, the Taliban’s acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, said that Mr. Frerichs, who had been held by the Taliban since 2020, had been handed over to the U.S. authorities at Kabul International Airport on Monday morning.In return, the United States released Mr. Noorzai, a prominent financier of the Taliban in the 1990s who is known for his close ties to the group’s founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar. Mr. Noorzai was convicted in the United States in 2008 of being part of an international narcotics trafficking conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison.The Taliban “is ready to solve problems by negotiation with all including the United States,” Mr. Muttaqi said at the news conference, sitting alongside Mr. Noorzai, who returned to Afghanistan on Monday after his release by U.S. authorities.President Biden said in a statement released by the White House on Monday that “bringing the negotiations that led to Mark’s freedom to a successful resolution required difficult decisions, which I did not take lightly.” He did not provide details about the negotiations or the decisions, but said that his administration “continues to prioritize the safe return of all Americans who are held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad.”In a call with reporters on Monday morning, two senior Biden administration officials said that Mr. Frerichs was in Doha and appeared to be in stable health, after an initial assessment from U.S. officials.They said that months of intense negotiations with the Taliban had made it clear that clemency and release for Mr. Noorzai was the key to securing Mr. Frerichs’ freedom. Experts across the U.S. government had concluded that Mr. Noorzai’s return to Afghanistan would not increase risks to Americans or change the Afghan drug trade, they said.The senior officials said that Mr. Biden was concerned for Mr. Frerichs after an American airstrike killed the leader of Al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahri, in downtown Kabul in August. The officials said the United States had warned the Taliban that they would be held responsible if Mr. Frerichs was harmed following the strike — and also told the group that freeing Mr. Frerichs would be a first step toward gaining more legitimacy on the world stage.It was the first known prisoner exchange between the United States and the Taliban since the group seized power in Afghanistan last year. The deal may bolster pragmatists within the Taliban leadership who have frequently clashed with the group’s top ideologues over the new government’s willingness to moderate on key policy issues — like allowing girls’ education — in order to meaningfully engage with the international community, analysts say.“This is tangible delivery for Taliban diplomacy and may counterbalance against some of the more isolationist factions — particularly in Kandahar — who just don’t see a point in speaking to foreigners,” said Graeme Smith, a senior consultant for the International Crisis Group who focuses on Afghanistan, referring to the southern heartland of the Taliban.Once listed by the United States as one of the world’s most wanted narcotics dealers, Mr. Noorzai was a prominent drug baron in Kandahar Province for decades. He earned a reputation in the 1990s as a major financier of the movement and a trusted associate of Mr. Omar, the group’s founder.After the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and toppled a previous Taliban government, Mr. Noorzai repositioned himself as an asset to American forces. He delivered U.S. troops huge caches of weapons the Taliban had stashed across the province, promised to use his influence among his southern tribe to stabilize the region and became known as one of Kandahar’s most prominent power brokers.But within months, his relationship with the Americans soured and he fled to neighboring Pakistan where he continued in the drug trade. In 2005, he came to New York to meet with U.S. officials who claimed the United States was interested in speaking with him about terrorism financing. But the meeting was a trap, he later testified. He was arrested 11 days later.Upon his return to Afghanistan on Monday morning, Mr. Noorzai was greeted by a large crowd of Taliban security forces, dressed in black, who draped strings of brightly colored flowers around his neck as he shook their hands triumphantly, a video showed.“I am proud to be in the capital of my country among my brothers,” Mr. Noorzai said at the news conference later Monday.The prisoner swap also capped a two-year-long saga since Mr. Frerichs, a former Navy diver who was working as a contractor in Afghanistan, was captured and taken hostage in January 2020. The kidnapping triggered a countrywide hunt to find Mr. Frerichs, whose release was raised during peace talks between the United States and the Taliban but ultimately left unresolved.Locating him became a priority for Americans officials after the United States and Taliban officials signed the Doha peace agreement in February that year and Western troops prepared to withdraw from the country.“I am so happy to hear that my brother is safe and on his way home to us,” Charlene Cakora, Mr. Frerichs’ sister, said in a statement. “We never gave up hope that he would survive and come home safely to us.”At least one other American, Ivor Shearer, is in Taliban custody. Mr. Shearer was working as an independent filmmaker in Kabul when he was detained along his Afghan producer in August, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a press watchdog.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Monday that the United States was determined to win the release of dozens of other Americans held abroad under what the administration calls unjust or coercive circumstances.“We will bring the same determination and focus to those efforts as we brought to the effort to bring Mark Frerichs out of captivity and home to his loved ones,” Mr. Blinken told reporters in New York.The exchange on Monday was the first major, public act of cooperation between the United States and the Taliban since the drone strike that killed Mr. Zawahri.The strike drew a sharp rebuke from Taliban officials, who characterized it as a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty, and raised questions about whether a new era of U.S. strikes in Afghanistan had begun. At the same time, the public revelation that the Taliban had been sheltering a key plotter of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States appeared to push the country further toward pariah state status.In the weeks since, the United States and Taliban have clashed over another key policy issue: The use of funds that Mr. Biden had frozen and seized from Afghanistan’s central bank after the Taliban took over the country last year.Last week, the Biden administration moved to establish a foundation based in Switzerland that would begin spending $3.5 billion of those funds to address the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Afghanistan, while keeping the funds out of the Taliban’s hands.The Taliban condemned the move, warning that if the United States proceeded with those plans they “will be forced to impose fines against, and ban activities of, all individuals, institutions and companies that facilitate this illegal venture and seek to misuse Central Bank reserves for humanitarian and other purposes,” according to a statement from the Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Yaqoob Akbary reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Christina Goldbaum from Sukkur, Pakistan. Reporting was contributed by Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan; Najim Rahim from San Francisco; Thomas Gibbons-Neff from Kostyantynivka, Ukraine; and Jim Tankersley and Michael Crowley from New York.</body>

	<title>Trump Was Warned Late Last Year of Potential Legal Peril Over Documents</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>A onetime White House lawyer under President Donald J. Trump warned him late last year that Mr. Trump could face legal liability if he did not return government materials he had taken with him when he left office, three people familiar with the matter said.The lawyer, Eric Herschmann, sought to impress upon Mr. Trump the seriousness of the issue and the potential for investigations and legal exposure if he did not return the documents, particularly any classified material, the people said.The account of the conversation is the latest evidence that Mr. Trump had been informed of the legal perils of holding onto material that is now at the heart of a Justice Department criminal investigation into his handling of the documents and the possibility that he or his aides engaged in obstruction.In January, not long after the discussion with Mr. Herschmann, Mr. Trump turned over to the National Archives 15 boxes of material he had taken with him from the White House. Those boxes turned out to contain 184 classified documents, the Justice Department has said.But Mr. Trump continued to hold onto a considerable cache of other documents, including some with the highest security classification, until returning some under subpoena in June and having even more seized in a court-authorized search of his Mar-a-Lago residence and private club by F.B.I. agents last month.The precise date of the late 2021 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Herschmann is unclear. It was also unclear what, if any, awareness Mr. Herschmann had of what was in the boxes when the subject was discussed.But by then, the National Archives had told associates of Mr. Trump that it was missing documents like original copies of his presidential correspondence with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and the letter left for him by President Barack Obama. Archives officials said they had been told by then that there were roughly two dozen boxes of documents that had been in the White House residence and which qualified as presidential records, which had never been sent to the archives.By the time of the meeting, Mr. Herschmann, a former prosecutor, was not working with or for Mr. Trump, from whom the National Archives had spent months trying to procure missing material.Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Herschmann for the discussion but was noncommittal about his plans for returning the documents, the people familiar with the conversation said.Mr. Herschmann, who defended Mr. Trump during his first impeachment trial but tried to stop several efforts by outside advisers aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2020 election, declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The meeting between Mr. Herschmann and Mr. Trump has not been previously reported, and it adds to the picture of Mr. Trump’s interactions with several people about returning the documents in the months before the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of material in January of this year. When they went through the boxes, officials at the archives discovered that they contained nearly 200 individual classified documents.It was not immediately clear if the meeting was solely related to the discussion about the documents, or if it was about other issues.Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including informal ones such as Tom Fitton, of the conservative legal advocacy group Judicial Watch, have told the former president that he could hold onto the documents as personal records, according to people briefed on their discussions.Mr. Trump is facing not just the investigation over potential mishandling of government records, but also a number of other inquiries, including a wide-ranging Justice Department investigation into what led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and a state investigation in Georgia into efforts to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election.Lawyers for Mr. Trump turned over an additional set of classified documents in June. The F.B.I. then carried out a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago on Aug. 8 and retrieved more than 100 additional individual documents with classified markings.A federal judge in Florida has at least temporarily barred the Justice Department from using the material seized in the search in pursuing its criminal investigation. On Friday, the department asked a federal appeals court to let the F.B.I. regain access to those 100 or so sensitive documents so it could continue the inquiry and assess the national security risks stemming from Mr. Trump keeping them in an unsecured location.The special master appointed to determine whether the material seized in the search is subject to attorney-client privilege or executive privilege is scheduled to meet with lawyers for Mr. Trump and the Justice Department on Tuesday.The first filings before Judge Raymond J. Dearie, the special master, suggested that the Trump legal team was not happy with early signs of how quickly he appears poised to try to resolve the matter.Judge Dearie had invited the Justice Department and the Trump legal team to submit letters on Monday proposing what they should talk about at a first meeting in his courtroom in the federal courthouse in Brooklyn on Tuesday.He also circulated a proposed calendar, which was not made public, for how the work flow could unfold.In its submission, the Trump legal team complained about that calendar. For example, Judge Dearie apparently proposed that both sides complete their sifting of the documents and proposals for how to label them by Oct. 7. After that deadline, Judge Dearie would write a report to a Trump-appointed judge, Aileen M. Cannon, who named him special master and set an overall deadline of Nov. 30, recommending how she should rule about any disagreements.The Trump legal team said Oct. 7 was far too early a date for that phase of the work to be done, writing: “We respectfully suggest that all of the deadlines can be extended to allow for a more realistic and complete assessment of the areas of disagreement.”Mr. Trump’s team had recommended Judge Dearie as a possible special master, and the Justice Department agreed.The website Axios reported that the Trump team did so because the lawyers believed that the judge shared their skepticism of the F.B.I., because he was one of the judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court who approved of warrants to surveil a 2016 Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page. Two of the four warrants the court approved were later declared invalid.Charlie Savage contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Your Tuesday Briefing: Britain Buries Queen Elizabeth II</title>
	<author>Amelia Nierenberg</author>
	<body>Queen Elizabeth II was buried in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, next to her husband, Prince Philip. It concluded the period of official mourning — a time of unifying grief and disorienting change.The state funeral began with a majestic service at Westminster Abbey. International dignitaries and about 200 people who had performed public services joined members of the royal family.The queen’s coffin then moved through London in a procession as tens of thousands of people watched. “They don’t make them like her anymore,” one woman said. “She was a one-off.”The funeral closed with a more intimate service and private internment. Before the final hymn, the crown jeweler removed the imperial state crown, the orb and the scepter from the queen’s coffin and placed them on the altar. The lord chamberlain broke his wand of office and placed it onto the coffin, a symbol of the end of his service, to be buried with the sovereign.Photos: See images from her life and a visual dictionary of the symbols of her reign.Reflection: The queen’s coronation and funeral have become the bookends of a generation, Alan Cowell, a contributor based in London, writes in an essay on her life.The 77th session of the U.N. General Assembly, the largest annual gathering of world leaders, began yesterday in New York City. Here’s what to expect.The meeting will be the first in-person General Assembly in three years, after the pandemic restricted movements. But the mood is likely to be a somber one. Leaders will address the war in Ukraine, mounting food and energy crises and concerns over climate disruptions, such as the floods in Pakistan.Tensions are expected to be high between Russia, the U.S. and European countries over Ukraine — and between China and the U.S. over Taiwan and trade. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, the leaders of Russia and China, are not expected to attend.“The General Assembly is meeting at a time of great peril,” António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, said last week.Analysis: “This is the first General Assembly of a fundamentally divided world,” said Richard Gowan, the U.N. director at International Crisis Group, a research group based in Brussels. “We have spent six months with everyone battering each other. The gloves are off.”South Korea: Yoon Suk Yeol, the new president of South Korea, is expected to address the General Assembly today. Last week, he told our Seoul bureau chief that it had become necessary — even inevitable — for South Korea to expand its security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo as North Korea intensified its nuclear threat.Other details: Narendra Modi, India’s leader, and Abiy Ahmed, the leader of Ethiopia, will also skip the meeting. The U.S. and Europe will most likely try to pressure Iran over the nuclear deal. And developing nations and the West will very likely spar over development aid.Russian missiles struck a second nuclear site in Ukraine yesterday, narrowly avoiding a possible calamity in the Mykolaiv region.Moscow damaged a hydroelectric station less than 900 feet (about 274 meters) from reactors at Ukraine’s second-biggest nuclear plant. (The occupied Zaporizhzhia site is the largest.) Despite the close call, there was no damage to essential safety equipment at the plant, which remained fully operational, Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company said.The explosion still caused extensive damage, forced the shutdown of one of the plant’s hydraulic units and led to partial power outages in the area. It also highlighted the threat to Ukraine’s critical infrastructure.“A few hundred meters and we would have woken up in a completely different reality,” a Ukrainian official said. Here are live updates.Details: Before the war, 15 working reactors at four nuclear power plants produced more than half of Ukraine’s electricity, the second-highest share among European nations after France.Other updates:Senior officials from China and Russia announced joint military exercises and enhanced defense cooperation.

	<title>How Health Care Workers Got Me Through the Pandemic</title>
	<author>Joshua Needelman</author>
	<body>This article is part of the I Want to Thank You series. We asked readers to tell us about who helped get them through the pandemic; this is a selection of their stories about health care workers. We’ve published an article about family and friends, and a forthcoming article will focus on inspirational figures.Health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic offered more than just medical services. They gave Americans emotional support, connection and innovative solutions.Here are the stories of a disabled woman, her father and her caretakers; a lawyer and her late mother’s physician; a woman with paraplegia and her home health aide; and a contact tracer.In 2001, Doug Jacoby was reading to his 5-year-old daughter, Devon, in their Easton, Conn., home when the book fell on the floor. She climbed off his lap and scooped it up — an innocuous moment for most families, but for the Jacobys it was groundbreaking.With that simple action, Devon, who has brain damage and is nonverbal, defied the doctors who had told her parents she would always be slow to respond to stimuli. (She does not have an official diagnosis but is “profoundly disabled,” her father said.)In 2020, Ms. Jacoby was receiving assistance at the Saint Catherine Center for Special Needs in Fairfield, Conn., and had been since she turned 21. But when the pandemic shut down the center, her progress was threatened: Constant engagement is crucial to Ms. Jacoby’s development, Mr. Jacoby said.“You fear that lacking the stimulus, lacking seeing the faces, lacking the experience, she will backslide and she will lose awareness,” Mr. Jacoby, 72, said.Then, in April 2020, the center began to offer virtual programming over Zoom, and for two to three hours per day Ms. Jacoby was engaged and happy. (Ms. Jacoby’s parents are divorced, and she splits time living with each of them.) During music therapy sessions, she would bop her head to the beat. When the center reopened in July 2020, Mr. Jacoby knew he was sending Ms. Jacoby, now 26, back to people who genuinely cared for her.“You don’t work with people like my daughter and do it well because it’s a job. You do it because it’s a calling,” Mr. Jacoby said. “I have too much gratitude to have the ability to express it.”The center’s virtual sessions also included weather updates and story time. During music therapy, Mr. Jacoby, who works from home as a freelance writer, would hold a wooden spoon in Ms. Jacoby’s hand and help her bang it against a pot.“It takes time to really get to know her, but when you do you can sense when she’s happy,” Mr. Jacoby said. “Most of the time with the music, most of the time during story time, you can tell that she was engaged.”Most of the calls Jackie Marzan made to her mother’s doctors to inform them of her death from Covid-19 in November 2020 followed a familiar script: The doctors expressed shock, offered their condolences and said goodbye.And then Ms. Marzan, sitting in her mother’s apartment in Queens, called Dr. Vanessa Tiongson, her mother’s neurologist at Mount Sinai Hospital. They spoke for more than two hours.“She was asking me, ‘How do you feel?’ And then she was sharing with me how she felt,” Ms. Marzan, 51, said. “She said, ‘Oh, your mom — I’m going to miss her. She was my favorite.’”Ms. Marzan’s mother, Aura Shirley Sarmiento, typically preferred that her doctors spoke Spanish; Dr. Tiongson did not, but earned Ms. Sarmiento’s trust nonetheless. Not long before her death, Ms. Sarmiento called Ms. Marzan crying tears of joy: Dr. Tiongson’s positive attitude had given her hope.Dr. Tiongson’s empathy stuck with Ms. Marzan as the pandemic decimated her family: Over the next year Ms. Marzan would lose her grandmother and two aunts to Covid. In April, her father-in-law also died from the virus.“Imagine the holidays, and you go home for the holidays and you see the kitchen full of women cooking,” Ms. Marzan said. “In my case, those are all the women cooking. They’re all gone.”As the months wore on, she found fewer conversation partners willing to discuss Covid and her family.“People don’t want to hear about Covid,” she said. “They say, ‘Oh, it’s not that bad anymore.’ It’s like, yeah, but Covid, it permeated our lives.”Dr. Tiongson didn’t forget. In January, Ms. Marzan received a holiday card from Dr. Tiongson, with a photo of the doctor’s children and a note expressing her love for Ms. Sarmiento. “I thought, Who does this?” Ms. Marzan said.Although she considers herself a minimalist, she said, she’ll always have room in her home for that card.Annie Verchick, a woman with paraplegia and a traumatic brain injury living in rural Laporte, Colo., has worked with a revolving door of home aides. But over the past couple of years, as the pandemic compounded Ms. Verchick’s isolation, her relationship with Karen Coty, a home aide, blossomed into friendship.In the spring of 2021, when Ms. Verchick was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, Ms. Coty accompanied Ms. Verchick to her appointments and brought her ginger ale and ice packs.“Again and again and again, she just showed up,” Ms. Verchick, 57, said.Ms. Coty first started working with Ms. Verchick in 2016, and soon they were playfully arguing about werewolf romance novels and dissecting “M*A*S*H,” the hit TV show that ran from 1972 to 1983.“It was OK to have things be silly and not be tragic all the time,” Ms. Verchick said. “Karen is really disinterested in treating people as though they’re special and precious, which makes her a big win for me. You don’t get to be special. You’re a whole human being — who’s in a chair. That’s a really rare attitude.”Ms. Coty stopped working with Ms. Verchick in November 2018 so she could attend school, before returning in the summer of 2019. When Ms. Verchick, who has neurogenic bowel dysfunction, had what she called an “incontinent disaster” and the aides scheduled to work that day couldn’t show up, she called Ms. Coty, who was there 10 minutes later. Ms. Coty cleaned everything up and slept over the next two nights.Ms. Coty resumed her post with Ms. Verchick and stayed through the pandemic. She left in July of this year to pursue other opportunities, but not before training Ms. Verchick’s new aides.“I don’t know that she realizes on any level how meaningful it is,” Ms. Verchick said of Ms. Coty’s friendship.Jennifer Guy Cook’s home was eerily quiet. So she filled it with the voices of strangers.Ms. Cook, 68, had spent the past three-plus decades running a day care out of her home in Brighton, N.Y. When she shut down the business because of the pandemic, she landed a position with New York State’s Covid contact tracing initiative. She had found a purpose: helping people through a tough time in their lives.For 20 hours per week, Ms. Cook would call people who had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid. Ms. Cook held the job only from December 2020 to June 2021, but she’s grateful for the connections she made.“I wanted to be a part of helping,” Ms. Cook said. “I could certainly make phone calls.”Amid the gray Brighton winter, Ms. Cook relished the human connection. (She would tease fathers who had forgotten their children’s birthdays, joking that mothers normally had a less difficult time remembering them.) Her job was, on the surface, informational: She was to provide facts about the virus and potential warning signs. But it turned into much more.“Some of the people that I talked to were just in that situation of being scared, and being worried, and being worried for their children, or being worried for their parents,” Ms. Cook said.That’s where Ms. Cook would interject with a light joke or words of encouragement. “It’s injecting your own humanity in the conversation,” she said. “And just by doing that, it changes everything.”</body>

	<title>Their Dad Was Like a Brother. Now Pacman Jones Is Family.</title>
	<author>Jonathan Abrams</author>
	<body>AMELIA, Ohio — Adam Jones’s days begin early.The alarms in his Cincinnati-area home blare for the brood of six kids at 6 a.m. on weekdays. And Jones, who is known as Pacman, and his wife, Tishana, alternate chauffeuring them to school and day care.To see Jones as a busy, car-pooling father is a sharp contrast from his days as a Pro Bowl defensive back who drew headlines off the football field. “I was the first of the era to let it be known, ‘Hey, people going to the strip clubs,’” Jones said. “Nobody wasn’t doing that before me. I started all that making it rain.”The comment is a reference to Jones’s behavior around the time of his most infamous infraction in 2007, when his showering a strip club dance floor with dollar bills led to a melee that left a security guard paralyzed from a gunshot wound. Jones was given one year of probation and was ordered by a civil jury to pay $11 million to two of the club’s employees. Because of that and other run-ins with the police, the N.F.L. suspended Jones for the season.That Jones, once one of the N.F.L.’s poster athletes for repeated misdeeds, is the head of a modern-day Brady Bunch will shock most casual fans of the game. But by shepherding the bursting household, Jones hopes he can help them all avoid some of his missteps, even as he strives to right his own path.Now, the value of the dollar is one of the key lessons Jones is trying to impart to all the children in his care. He and Tishana provide them with allowances to help them learn how to manage money.One recent morning, the kids awoke to find Jones muddied and sweaty. He had spent the predawn hours cleaning out the gutters after a person whom he had hired for the job did not show up.“Damn near killed myself, but it was just the point of letting them know, yeah, we got money, but, I can go and do this myself if I had to,” Jones said.It’s another lesson Jones is trying to instill within the growing house, which now includes the teenage sons of Chris Henry, the college teammate and close friend Jones called Slim, who died in 2009.When Jones approached their mother, Loleini Tonga, about the boys coming to live with him, she said she felt like a prayer had silently been answered. She would miss the boys, but had wondered how she would help them navigate their teens without a male presence.Chris Henry Jr. is a lanky, 15-year-old high school freshman wide receiver with lofty gridiron dreams that match those of his father, who died when Chris Jr. was 2.Though he has watched video of Chris Sr. playing with him and his siblings, he does not remember much about his father. Jones is there to fill in the gaps, offering a fuller portrait of Henry.“He was special, man,” Jones said of Chris Sr. “When you see Man-Man” — Chris Jr. — “it’s like a spitting image. For real, the way he walks, the way he talks.”The way the teenager glides on the football field gives Jones chills, just like the kid’s ability to fall asleep nearly anywhere off it.Last year, Adam and Tishana invited Chris Jr. and DeMarcus, 13, to move in and signed custodial papers so they could help the boys navigate big-time high school athletics and the minefield of college recruiting.“It’s motivating me every day,” Chris Jr. said. “Grinding, getting better, so I can eventually, one day, be better than him.”Their sister, Seini Hicks, a 16-year-old basketball player being eyed by several colleges, joined them this year. (Hicks is Tonga’s daughter from a previous relationship.)“We’ve done a really collectively, I feel, a great job of really making sure that they know their father and his presence,” Tishana Jones said.Throughout their youthful, heady days, Jones and Chris Sr. felt as if only they understood what it meant to operate under the N.F.L. microscope, gifted with money, fame and no road map for managing it all.They talked often on the phone, losing hours laughing, always ending their calls by promising each they would be all right.Then one day the calls stopped.Days before Christmas in 2009, Henry, then a Cincinnati Bengals receiver, was bickering with Tonga, his fiancée, at her home in Charlotte, N.C. As she left the house, he climbed into the bed of her pickup but later fell from the moving truck and died from his injuries at 26. Jones, 38, has carried Henry’s memory with him since. “A part of his heart chipped off and left with him,” Tishana Jones said of her husband.They both bend their schedules and budget to nurture their children. Jones’s oldest daughter, Zaniyah, 16, is a track star at his old high school in Atlanta but visits often. Then there’s Triniti, 12, Adam Jr., 4 — Tishana and Adam’s kids together — and Dantrell Moses, 15, who also plays football. Jones said he had done “pretty much everything that I can think that I want to do as far as in my lifetime.” He added: “I love hard and I’m real big on this family thing.”Jones thought of Henry and the weight of caring for his friend’s children. Tears replaced chills. A stream quickly replaced a trickle.“I can’t fake this,” he said. “I really, really love these kids.”He and Chris Sr. fought like family back in college. Chris Henry arrived to college at West Virginia from Louisiana in 2002, talented but insular. He redshirted his freshman year and in Jones’s estimation, put forth little effort.But Jones, also a freshman, could see Henry’s untapped athleticism, the ease with which the lanky receiver excelled when he chose to. So he decided to get closer to him. Jones warned their coach, Rich Rodriguez, against interrupting any arguments between him and Henry during practices.Jones challenged and poked Henry, all the while talking trash. Henry responded. The competition elevated the entire program to a ranking as high as sixth in the country.Henry mixed his talent with a temper. In the fourth quarter of a 2004 game against Rutgers he received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after hauling in a 69-yard touchdown. After another touchdown catch a few minutes later, Henry tossed the ball at the defensive back he had beaten, drawing an ejection.Making the N.F.L. had always been the goal for Jones and Henry, and together they declared early for the 2005 draft.Henry was selected in the third round by the Bengals and quickly developed into a deep-threat favorite of quarterback Carson Palmer in his rookie season. Unbeknown to many, he worked quietly with the team on learning how to be a professional.“Chris would spend a lot of the afternoons in my office with our people from public relations, to help mentor, counsel him how to present himself, how to speak during an interview,” said Marvin Lewis, who coached Henry and later Jones in Cincinnati.In Tennessee, Jones, whom the Titans selected with the No. 6 overall pick, quickly developed a reputation for creating havoc on and off the field. A daring kick returner, Jones took pride in rarely signaling for a fair catch — inviting opponents to try to catch him. As a defensive back, receivers seldom found separation from Jones, who made a habit of gobbling up interceptions.The play and memorable nickname proved lucrative for Jones.“It changed me because I didn’t know the value of a dollar,” he said of the newfound fame and money.Henry’s and Jones’s off-field transgressions nearly cost them their N.F.L. careers. In 2007, Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended each for separate violations of the N.F.L.’s personal conduct policy on the same day: Jones for an entire season and Henry for eight games after both had a series of police run-ins and arrests.Jones has since gotten chances to straighten his career and life trajectory. He does not regard himself as a finished product: He drew N.F.L. fines for dirty plays during his tenure with the Bengals and last year, Jones pleaded no contest to an assault at a nightclub.Every day gives Jones a chance to build a future. Henry lost that opportunity.When he died, Seini, Chris Jr. and DeMarcus were all younger than 4. Once the initial wave of mourners stopped calling to check in, “Uncle Pac” and Aunt Tish kept inviting Tonga and the whole crew to visit Cincinnati in the summer. The Joneses chatted with them by video call while they were in Charlotte during the school year and regularly surprised the growing children by sending boxes of athletic gear.The year after Henry’s death, Tishana delivered Triniti just 23 weeks into her pregnancy with Jones on the verge of signing with the Bengals after tumultuous stints with the Titans and the Dallas Cowboys.Serving suspensions and awaiting a team to sign him, Jones said he felt lonely without the game, betrayed that he had helped out supposed friends and teammates who deserted him when it seemed as if his career would not recover. Now, he had a child who he could not let down.Tishana and Jones spent the next four months of training camp and the season’s start driving nearly two hours after practice to see Triniti at a hospital. “When you can’t do nothing about it, it puts you in a different place and makes you be thankful for the little things,” Jones said.Lewis joked that he had never once called Jones “Pacman.” Over eight seasons together with the Bengals, the coach found Jones far more likable and knowledgeable than he had read and heard about. He was there when Jones married Tishana in 2014, after years of dating, and recalled their wedding where the reception dinner consisted of chicken wings and macaroni and cheese.“We all had a ball because we all realized the significance of this day and what it took to get him there,” Lewis said. “And then watching him up there during the wedding, organizing everybody, making sure everybody was doing what they were supposed to do while he was getting married, it was like he was the wedding coordinator.”Jones rallied and resuscitated his career, retiring in 2019 as the last active defensive player from his 2005 draft class.“She taught me patience,” Jones said. “Because my patience wasn’t really like it is now. Younger, growing up, you used to keep your guard up all the time. Like, ‘I got to defend myself. I got to defend myself. I got to defend myself.’ You got to get yourself in some kind of place where you’re happy and cool, where you don’t have to go out and try to defend yourself every day.”During an August early afternoon, Jones sat in the offices of a spacious sports complex he purchased just outside Cincinnati. Adam Jr., who would start prekindergarten in a couple weeks, had just performed agility drills that no one his age should be capable of.Jones figured he could overpay someone to train his children or save money, invest his time and do it himself, while inviting others from his community.Tonga was in town, staying under the same roof, to see her children. Along with the Joneses, they decided to spend the rest of the afternoon checking in on the boys at football practice before attending Seine’s volleyball game that night.They exited the gym to a sunny day.“Bye, Mommy,” Adam Jr., who goes by Junie, said. “Bye, Daddy. I love you.”“I’m going to be watching you,” Jones cautioned to Triniti, who stayed to babysit Adam Jr. and Ofa, Tonga’s 7-year-old daughter.Jones pulled up his phone to show lives cameras of the gym.“See this?” he said. “You’re on Candid Camera.”The parents ducked into separate white Mercedes cars — Jones by himself and Tishana and Tonga together.At his practice, Chris Jr. stood a football helmet above any other teammate. He is tall enough to have once innocently asked Jones if he will grow out of the sport that he has loved since he can recall.A helpless defender did everything but tackle him on a one-on-one drill. Chris Jr. still easily caught the ball.“That’s 16 flags,” said Dee Alston, West Clermont High School’s offensive coordinator and another teammate of Henry and Jones at West Virginia.Jones bounced around the field, going over techniques with some of the team’s defensive backs, before leaving with Tishana and Tonga around 5 p.m. for a quick drive to West Clermont Middle School to catch the end of DeMarcus’s football practice.Nicknamed Bubba by his father for his chubbiness as a baby, DeMarcus is another lanky receiver with silky hands, but he prefers basketball for now. “I just love getting buckets,” he said.The Joneses and Tonga returned to the gym around 6 p.m., picking up Adam Jr. and Ofa on the way so everyone could attend Seini’s high school volleyball game.“We love each other as if we all came out the same stomach,” Tonga said.The children piled into the stands. Jones watched for a while before slipping outside to the field where there was a varsity soccer game.A couple teenagers outside the gym approached Jones for photographs as he discussed his business ventures, including a cannabis store and the I AM ATHLETE podcast, of which he is a host.The sun started to set on another busy day. Jones contemplated getting in one final workout with the children at the gym.He considered it a day well spent — one that Henry would be proud of.“I ain’t saying that I got it all right now, but I’m way better than what I was,” Jones said.</body>

	<title>A Key to Controlling Emissions: More Buildings in a City’s Unused Spaces</title>
	<author>Peter Wilson</author>
	<body>This article is part of Climate Solutions, a special report on efforts to make a difference, coinciding with The New York Times Climate Forward conference and Climate Week NYC.Just south of the River Thames in the heart of London, the whine and hammering of construction mingles with the laughter of children playing in a park behind Elephant and Castle, one of the city’s largest and ugliest road junctions.This is Elephant Park, a three-acre plot of fountains, swings and slides and open space at the center of a large redevelopment which has seen the Brutalist architecture of a 1,200-home public housing estate replaced by a new neighborhood that by 2026 will hold about 2,924 apartments and townhouses.About two thousand units are already occupied, and the residents who walk their dogs in the park or watch their children playing seem happy to chat about the normal issues surrounding regeneration projects, such as the fate of the previous residents and whether the gentrification will drive away noisy youths who still loiter in the park after dark.One resident walking her dog complained recently that her rent is becoming unaffordable, before quickly adding that she is delighted to have a supermarket and gym in the same building as her one-bedroom apartment, with rail and Underground stations right next door and shops, bars, a yoga studio, a library and medical facilities sprinkled through the development.But another debate is drawing extra attention to Elephant Park: the role of large scale urban renewal projects like this in fighting climate change.“It is an absolutely exemplary example of what we need to be doing to make cities greener, and we need to be doing it quickly and all around the world,” said Kate Meyrick, a British-born urban consultant based in Brisbane, Australia, who studies urban developments.“The developers were primarily just trying to make a great place for people to live, and they have achieved that with a really interesting mix of spaces and services,” she said. “But a byproduct is that they have also created real climate benefits.”In April the latest report of the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said one of the most effective ways to cut the carbon emissions of cities was to stop the relentless expansion of urban sprawl by promoting infill housing, the carefully planned creation of extra housing in underutilized parts of cities to reduce car dependence and improve the efficiency of infrastructure and energy use.Ms. Meyrick is adamant that the biggest benefits of infill housing come with neighborhood-scale developments like the Elephant Park project built by developer Lendlease, rather than scattering new houses and units through backyards and other empty city spaces.Large scale infill developments have reinvigorated cities from New York to Milan over the past two decades, Ms. Meyrick said, “but they have generally been driven by the need for housing and now they need to be much more recognized and promoted as a weapon against climate change.”Hélène Chartier, the Paris-based director of urban planning and design at C40, a network of 96 of the world’s leading cities, agreed that the greatest climate benefits of infill housing come at neighborhood scale. She said there should be urgent public investment and revamped planning rules to support such developments.“This is becoming a hot topic in all the major cities because people now realize that well-planned infill housing can help to reduce emissions from all sorts of sources, from transport to construction and heating,” she said.Ms. Chartier said the CoolClimate Network at the University of California, Berkeley, had recently looked at the emissions of 700 communities in California and found that “infill housing is probably the single most impactful measure that cities could take to reduce their emissions.”“The question now is how do we do it, and there is a growing recognition that the broadest benefits come from operating at a neighborhood level,” Ms. Chartier said.Bek Seeley, the LendLease managing director responsible for Elephant Park, says small-scale infill projects “can produce some amazing homes” but only larger developments can reap the full advantages of coordinating with public transport and ensuring a mix of facilities so people can travel less.Planning officials from Melbourne, Australia, and Auckland, New Zealand, to Paris have focused on the concept of five-minute neighborhoods or 15-minute cities, meaning denser housing in which people live closer to the facilities they need instead of traveling for hours between separate areas to sleep, work or go shopping.Peter Newman, a professor of sustainability at Curtin University in Australia, who has taught at universities in eight countries, including at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Virginia, says many cities are trying to stop urban sprawl by allowing property owners to build in their backyards, “but tackling it one block of land at a time doesn’t work.”“You knock down the trees in the backyard to build, but you can end up still being very dependent on your car,” he said. “Until now the only way to avoid eating up the greenfields around cities has been developing brownfields or big urban sites like former factories, but eventually you run out of them.”The answer, Mr. Newman said, is precinct-level redevelopment in “the greyfields”, or low-density suburbs of aging houses, a process that requires innovative planning reforms and incentives to encourage the owners of 30 to 40 properties to work together.“You need a whole new process of governments proactively intervening to help it happen,” Mr. Newman said, “and that can cause conflict between different levels of government. In Australia we have found that the state government might be interested but then a local council stops everything because it controls the planning rules and it’s not at all interested in being innovative.“The hard truth is that we can’t afford to waste more time if we are going to make the changes we need to get to net zero,” he said, referring to emissions goals, “and stop building new homes 30 miles from where they are needed.”It was local government resistance that led the California State Assembly to pass a bill in August promoting the development of infill housing on commercial-zoned land. A dire housing crisis in the state has pitted local authorities against the state, where legislators, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other officials are mounting a broad effort to address the so-called NIMBY-ism — “Not In My Backyard” — of homeowners, communities and entire municipalities to block more condensed development.Dr. Dan Silver, a physician and executive director of a southern Californian conservation group, the Endangered Habitats League, said the infill housing bill was needed because “no matter how important it is to stop urban sprawl there will always be some people who don’t want their own neighborhood changed.”“It’s controversial because the state is taking away some of the authority of local governments, but while you do need local input, having too much local control means you can’t deal with a macro problem like trying to save the planet,” Dr. Silver said.“We have to shift planning frameworks to look at the bigger picture,” he added. “In California the fire danger alone is phenomenal from continuing to build homes further and further from cities.”The Covid pandemic has increased the number of underused offices, shopping malls and parking lots that are available for housing, at a time when many people are rethinking their lifestyles and the wisdom of long commutes, Dr. Silver said.“Oregon is an exception because it does actually have plans for managing growth and making cities denser and more transit-oriented, but in California and other states we are way behind on planning and thinking about the big picture,” he said.“What we call ‘town planning’ is done in response to developers or speculators, so that is not actually planning or taking a holistic approach that might respond to something as important as climate change,” he said. “And what’s the point of having international agreements and national decisions if the action you need is then prevented at the local level?”Careful town planning is crucial, according to the C40 network, which says a problem plaguing many cities around the world, especially smaller communities, is under resourcing of urban planning bodies.A study of climate planning policies in 170 California communities led by the University of California Santa Cruz found in February that a shortage of resources and urban planning expertise was one of the reasons that the relatively easier challenges of tree planting and waste management were more often tackled than the thornier issues of urban density, housing and infrastructure.Vanesa Castan Broto, a professor of climate urbanism at the University of Sheffield in the U.K., said greater urban density can easily go wrong if not developed in partnership with local communities, and many local governments around the world lack the capacity to properly coordinate that process.Richard Blyth, the head of policy at the U.K.’s Royal Town Planning Institute, said the planning departments of many British local councils had been gutted over the past decade.“Planning agencies are hardly going to be able to adjust to changing lifestyles or a huge challenge like climate change if they have lost so many resources that they are struggling to function at all,” he said.</body>

	<title>Sean Hayes to Star in Broadway Play About Oscar Levant</title>
	<author>Michael Paulson</author>
	<body>It was two decades ago when a friend first suggested to Sean Hayes that he consider playing Oscar Levant. He still remembers his reaction: “Who the hell is Oscar Levant?”Levant, he quickly learned, was a pianist who in the mid-20th century became famous for the mordant wit he displayed as a guest and host on radio and television talk shows, but had a life that was challenged by struggles with mental health and addiction. When another friend suggested Hayes think about Levant as a character, he got serious — watching archival footage, reading Levant’s books, and imagining some kind of performance.There were detours along the way — at one point, Hayes hoped to play Levant in a Steven Spielberg movie about George Gershwin, but the movie never happened — though the suggestion led to an idea which led to a script which led to a production, and next spring that show, called “Good Night, Oscar,” is coming to Broadway with Hayes in the leading role.“If I had nothing to do with this show, I would be absolutely enthralled with this human being that is Oscar Levant — he’s just incredible,” Hayes said in a telephone interview. “I’m just surprised how famous he was, and now nobody knows who he is. So another thrill for me is to reintroduce him to people, because he deserves to be remembered.”The show, by Doug Wright, had a first run earlier this year at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, where the Chicago Tribune critic Chris Jones raved about the play, and about Hayes.“It’s a stunner of a lead performance: moving, empathetic, deeply emotional and slightly terrifying,” Jones wrote. “Once this show arrives on Broadway, as it surely will, Hayes’ work here will be the talk of New York. So will the show, a piece with enough guts to take on the you-must-not-offend-me crew that now seems to run an industry actually founded on creative freedom.”The play, directed by Lisa Peterson, is scheduled to begin previews April 7 and to open April 24 at the Belasco Theater. The lead producers are Grove Entertainment (Beth Williams and Mindy Rich) and Barbara Whitman.Hayes, 52, is best known for his starring role on the television show “Will &amp; Grace” (he played Jack). He has appeared on Broadway twice previously, scoring a Tony nomination in 2010 for his work in a revival of the musical “Promises, Promises,” and then in 2016 starring in a return engagement of the comedic play “An Act of God.”Hayes said he and Levant, although quite different in many ways, share traits that make the role interesting.“I know how it feels to have performance anxiety when playing piano — that was my major in college, I studied for 20 years, I thought I was going to be a conductor and a concert pianist, and that didn’t work out, and it didn’t work out for Oscar either,” he said. “It worked out that he was second banana in a bunch of movies, and I think I’m perceived as that even though the dream is always to lead and not follow.”And there’s more, Hayes said.“I don’t have any drug addiction, like he did, but the anxiety — I’m riddled with it, and some of the depression I have, so that’s kind of interesting,” Hayes said. “It’s just a dream come true for an actor to play a character with so many different facets and levels to him — you wish every part that you ever played in your life was as colorful.”Wright won both a Tony and a Pulitzer in 2004 for his play “I Am My Own Wife,” and he has written the book for four Broadway musicals, including “The Little Mermaid” and “Grey Gardens.” Wright also happened to be the screenwriter for the unproduced Spielberg film about Gershwin, who for a time was a close collaborator with Levant.“The Chicago run was exhilarating — we learned that Oscar’s humor isn’t dated, that it still feels topical, that it still has the power to shock and delight, and that, as one of the first historical figures to openly talk about his own battles with mental illness, we found audiences really responded to not only his humor but his vulnerability, as well,” Wright said.“One reason he has been so interesting to explore in the moment is he provokes a lot of questions about the role of humor in a culture — and, when a culture is under siege, what role can humor play,” Wright said. He added, “What are tenable subjects for humor, and doesn’t humor have a certain duty to, at times, rile and offend and invite change?”</body>

	<title>Videos Show Trump Allies Handling Georgia Voting Equipment</title>
	<author>Nick Corasaniti</author>
	<body>Newly released videos show allies of former President Donald J. Trump and contractors who were working on his behalf handling sensitive voting equipment in a rural Georgia county weeks after the 2020 election.The footage, which was made public as part of long-running litigation over Georgia’s voting system, raises new questions about efforts by Trump affiliates in a number of swing states to gain access to and copy sensitive election software, with the help of friendly local election administrators. One such incident took place on Jan. 7 of last year, the day after supporters of Mr. Trump stormed the Capitol, when a small team traveled to rural Coffee County, Ga.The group included members of an Atlanta-based firm called SullivanStrickler, which had been hired by Sidney Powell, a lawyer advising Mr. Trump who is also a conspiracy theorist.“We are on our way to Coffee County, Ga., to collect what we can from the election/voting machines and systems,” one of the company’s executives, Paul Maggio, wrote Ms. Powell on that January morning. Weeks later, Scott Hall, an Atlanta-area Trump supporter and bail bondsman who also traveled to Coffee County, said “we scanned every freaking ballot” in a recorded phone conversation.Mr. Hall said the team had the blessing of the local elections board and “scanned all the equipment, imaged all the hard drives and scanned every single ballot.”The new videos show members of the team inside an office handling the county’s poll pads, which contain sensitive voter data. (The cases holding the equipment in the footage are labeled with the words “POLL PAD.”) In a court hearing on Sept. 9, David D. Cross, a lawyer for a nonprofit group that is suing over perceived security vulnerabilities in Georgia’s voting system — and that released the new videos after obtaining them in its litigation — told a judge that his group suspected that the “personally identifiable information” of roughly seven million Georgia voters may have been copied.Charles Tonnie Adams, the elections supervisor of Heard County, Ga., said in an email that “poll pads contain every registered voter on the state list.” It was not immediately clear what specific personal information about voters was on the poll pads, or what, if anything, was done with the data.Mike Hassinger, a spokesman for Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, said a poll pad “does have voter information but it’s not accessible because it’s scrambled behind security protocols.” He added that there were no driver’s license numbers or Social Security numbers on poll pads at the time.The new videos also show that some of the Trump allies who visited Coffee County were given access to a storage room, and that various people affiliated with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or his allies, had access to the building over several days.The new footage also shows Cathy Latham, then the head of the county’s Republican Party, with members of the Trump team, standing together in an office where the county’s poll pads were laid out on a table. Ms. Latham is among the targets of a criminal investigation in Atlanta, related to her participation as one of an alternate slate of electors who tried to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss in Georgia. That investigation, which is being led by Fani T. Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, has also touched on what took place in Coffee County.In a court filing late Monday evening, the plaintiffs in the civil case assailed what they called “the persistent refusal of Latham and her counsel to be straight with this court about the facts.” They accused her of downplaying her involvement with the Trump team when “she literally directed them on what to collect in the office.”Robert D. Cheeley, a lawyer for Ms. Latham, declined to speak on the record on Monday. This month, he told CNN that his client “would not and has not knowingly been involved in any impropriety in any election.”Investigators from Mr. Raffensperger’s office also appear in the new videos, raising questions about what they knew. Along with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Raffensperger’s office is investigating what took place in Coffee County, 200 miles southeast of Atlanta, but voting rights advocates involved in the litigation have questioned why Mr. Raffensperger, the defendant in the civil case, did not move more aggressively.Mr. Hassinger said the secretary of state’s office had “no idea” why its investigators were at the elections office in Coffee County in early January.“We are looking into it,” he said. “Again, we take this very seriously. This investigation is a joint effort between the secretary of state’s office and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and if it’s determined that people have committed a crime, they’re going to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”Mr. Hassinger added that at that time, the secretary of state’s office was looking at “vote-counting procedures when Coffee County was unable to certify the results of their election by the time of the deadline.”In a statement on Tuesday morning, SullivanStrickler said that it had received a subpoena from a special grand jury in Fulton County convened by Ms. Willis.“We can confirm that SullivanStrickler is not a target of the Fulton County special grand jury’s investigation,” the statement said. “Our firm and our employees are only witnesses in this matter. We will continue to fully cooperate with law enforcement.”Reached by phone on Monday, Rachel Ann Roberts, the current election supervisor for Coffee County, said she could not comment on the matter of the poll pads because she had started the job after the visit took place.“I’m not certain about any of that,” she said. “I wasn’t here at the time.”Georgia is hardly the only state where such activity occurred. In Michigan, a special prosecutor is investigating efforts by Trump allies, including the Republican candidate for attorney general, Matthew DePerno, to gain access to voting machines. And in Colorado, the secretary of state’s office estimated that taxpayers faced a bill of at least $1 million to replace voting equipment in Mesa County after a pro-Trump elections supervisor was indicted on charges that she tampered with the county’s voting equipment after the 2020 election.</body>

	<title>Review: ‘Marie It’s Time’ Pieces Together a Woman in Fragments</title>
	<author>Alexis Soloski</author>
	<body>Girlish, perilous, sexy and bleak, Minor Theater’s “Marie It’s Time,” at HERE, resurrects a marginal character from an influential work of modern drama. Then it kills her again. In this three-actor play, the playwright Julia Jarcho and the director Ásta Bennie Hostetter initiate a dialogue with Georg Büchner’s “Woyzeck,” an expressionist take on true crime left unfinished at the time of Büchner’s early death.“Woyzeck,” inspired by an early 19th-century scandal, centers on a sometime soldier who murders Marie, his common-law wife and the mother of his child, after she sleeps with a drum major. Woyzeck’s Marie isn’t granted much interiority in Büchner’s text, which makes “Marie It’s Time” a kind of reclamation, homage and clapback, even if Marie doesn’t survive for long here either.Jarcho splits Marie’s identity between two actors. Jarcho is one of them. Jennifer Seastone, a Minor Theater regular, is the other. Seastone plays a character named Marie — a breathy, lipsticked femme who knows the fatality is coming. Jarcho is Mag, a harassed mom in jeans and a sloppy sweater, introduced while cradling a screaming baby. (Each also takes turns playing Frank, the baby’s volatile father.) The women’s eyes are caught by Major (Kedian Keohan), a traveling musician in skinny jeans with a louche repertory of songs that describe and promise violence. Violence may be what Marie and Mag want. Certainly, it is what they expect. (Jarcho is also an academic, and her new book project explores theater and masochism. These ideas clearly absorb her.)As a playwright, Jarcho (“Pathetic,” “Grimly Handsome”) specializes in the weirdness and danger throbbing just below the surface of ordinary life, like a forehead vein that won’t stop pulsing. This creates an odd tangle of heightened emotions and ultranormal textures. Here, the style is broadly presentational, with some dialogue spoken into stand microphones and other lines rendered without amplification. It’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s a mind game. Or maybe it’s all mind games?Mag and Marie’s home, represented by an alphabet rug and a pile of laundry baskets, doubles, without adjustments, as a nightspot, a barbershop, a field. (The set is by Meredith Ries.) Hostetter doesn’t make the most of the confined downstairs space at Here. Despite the collection of doors and apertures in the set, the actors’ bodies inhabit it in limited ways. Still Ebony Burton’s lighting, which suggests a club in the weary, early morning moments before the work lights come on, and Ben Williams and Elliot Yokum’s ominous sound design provide greater ambience.Running just over an hour, “Marie It’s Time” is an intentionally narrow work and a recursive one, an echo chamber in which love and harm reverberate. It explores men’s violence against women, but as there aren’t any cisgender men onstage (Keohan is a trans actor), it does so in a way that feels both dangerous and appropriately safe, provocative without being exploitative. It returns agency to Marie, particularly when Seastone, an actress of great and strange charisma, steps up to the microphone. Then again, agency only goes so far. Marie still dies. She always dies.Jarcho and Hostetter create a world in which violence against women exerts a constant pressure — a grim attitude, but not one that invites a lot of argument. In a bitter coincidence, one of Major’s songs, “Keys in My Hand,” somehow reframed a joke I made to a friend a couple of weeks ago: that I never feel more feminine than when I’m walking home at night, keys laced through my fingers. Which is to say that “Marie It’s Time” — small and finely wrought — is a jewel box of a play. And that you may not want to reach your hand inside.Marie It’s TimeThrough Oct. 1 at HERE, Manhattan; here.org. Running time: 1 hour 15 minutes.</body>

	<title>Democracy Challenged</title>
	<author>Joseph Kahn</author>
	<body>This is an election year unlike any we’ve experienced in recent decades. Not only do candidates of both major parties in the United States have starkly different views on the pressing issues of the day, including climate change, war, taxes, abortion, education, gender and sexual identity, immigration, crime and the role of government in American life. They also disagree on democracy itself, especially one of its essential pillars — willingness to accept defeat at the polls.All year, our staff has sought to balance what we think of as politics, the candidates, polling, policy positions, campaign strategies, and views of voters on important issues, with coverage of acute challenges to democracy. Those include a deterioration in the integrity of constitutional democracy, manipulation of state election laws to limit or overturn the will of voters, and a global trend toward autocracy in places where democratic institutions once seemed solid. While we may continue to witness robust political competition in this midterm election cycle in ways that appear in keeping with American history, threats to that electoral system have grown relentlessly at the same time. Our coverage must examine both.So while we have a large staff dedicated to reporting on politics, a special team of some of our best journalists, nationally and internationally, has produced dozens of explanatory and investigative stories on the causes of our democratic decline. These include the rise in political violence, especially on the right, election denial and its hold on many Republicans, disinformation and the profiteers peddling falsehoods, the people and money behind the Jan. 6 insurrection, the origins and popularity of leading conspiracy theories, and the partisan political motives of some leading jurists.It is our deep and ongoing commitment to expose the cancers eating away at democracy, as well as joining the search for solutions. We have been gathering our coverage in a collection called Democracy Challenged.The latest piece in the collection, by David Leonhardt, covers the two biggest threats to American democracy: first, a movement within the Republican Party that refuses to accept election defeat; and, second, a growing disconnect between public opinion and government power. Below, we summarize the main points:The Jan. 6 attack on Congress was only the most obvious manifestation of the movement that refuses to accept election defeat. Hundreds of elected Republican officials around the country falsely claim that the 2020 election was rigged, suggesting they may be willing to overturn a future election. “There is the possibility, for the first time in American history, that a legitimately elected president will not be able to take office,” Yascha Mounk, a political scientist, said.Even many Republicans who do not repeat the election lies have chosen to support and campaign for those who do. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House leader, has gone so far as to support colleagues who have used violent imagery in public comments, such as calling for the killing of Democrats.But there are also many senior Republicans who have signaled they would be unlikely to participate in an effort to overturn an election, including Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. He recently said that the United States had “very little voter fraud.”This combination suggests that the risk of an overturned election remains uncertain. But the chances are much higher than would have been fathomable until the past few years. Previous leaders of both parties consistently rejected talk of reversing an election outcome.In addition to this acute threat, American democracy also faces a chronic threat: The power to set government policy is becoming increasingly disconnected from public opinion.Two of the past four presidents have taken office despite losing the popular vote. Senators representing a majority of Americans are often unable to pass bills, partly because of the increasing use of the filibuster. And the Supreme Court is dominated by an ambitious Republican-appointed bloc even though Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections — an unprecedented run of popular-vote success in U.S. history.Parties in previous eras that fared as well in the popular vote as the Democrats have fared in recent decades were able to run the government and pass policies they favored. Examples include the Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson’s time, the New Deal Democrats and the Reagan Republicans.The growing disconnect from federal power and public opinion generally springs from enduring features of American government, some written into the Constitution. But these features did not conflict with majority opinion to the same degree in past decades. One reason is that less populous and more populous states tended to have broadly similar political outlooks in the past.A sorting of the population in recent decades has meant that the less-populated areas given outsize influence by the Constitution also tend to be conservative, while major metropolitan areas have become more liberal. In the past, “the system was still antidemocratic, but it didn’t have a partisan effect,” said Steven Levitsky, another political scientist. “Now it’s undemocratic and has a partisan effect.”Over the sweep of history, the American government has tended to become more democratic, through women’s suffrage, civil rights laws, the direct election of senators and more. The current period is so striking partly because it is one of the rare exceptions: The connection between government power and popular opinion has become weaker in recent decades.Here is the full story on democracy’s twin crises.The following are some of the other articles in The Times’s continuing series, Democracy Challenged:The election-denier movement didn’t start in 2020. It began even before the Trump presidency.The Arizona Republican Party’s experiment: First, it turned against the establishment. Now it has moved to anti-democracy sentiment — the principles, the process and even the word itself.A team of Times journalists analyzed 1,150 episodes of Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show and produced an interactive feature explaining how he pushes extremist ideas and conspiracy theories into millions of households.As American feminists came together in 2017 to protest Donald Trump, Russia’s disinformation machine set about deepening the divides among them.Viktor Orban — Hungary’s populist prime minister and a hero to many American conservatives — changed voting rules to help his re-election campaign.The economy remains the top concern for voters, a New York Times/Siena poll found, as Republicans focus their campaigns on inflation.Texas sent Lever Alejos, a Venezuelan migrant, on a bus to Washington, D.C. Two months later, he is making a new life for himself.Trump is involved in six separate investigations. Here’s where each of them stands.Russia has begun using Iranian-made attack drones to counteract heavy artillery provided by the U.S.Alla Pugacheva, a pop music icon once called “the most popular human being in Russia,” declared her opposition to the invasion.A video showed Russian mercenaries offering to release convicts from prison in return for a six-month combat tour in Ukraine.When Russian troops withdraw, they leave a trail of anonymous death.Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral is today.

	<title>Do You Need a ‘Correct Attitude’ to Understand Your Mind?</title>
	<author>Rachel Aviv</author>
	<body>Several years ago, when I was reporting on clinics for people in the earliest stages of psychosis, I met many young patients who were struggling to express what was happening to their minds. They described their condition as disabling, but it was still so new that it had not remade their identities or social worlds. When I asked one woman to describe her symptoms, she told me there was no language. She said, “It’s like trying to explain what a bark sounds like to someone who’s never heard of a dog.”Another woman, a graduate student who had just been diagnosed with schizophrenia, started keeping a journal when she realized she was having psychological experiences that she didn’t know how to describe. She began making up phrases: She was struggling with “migrating electrical sensations” and the sense that “words were alive.” She became preoccupied by what she described as the “overwhelming strangeness of the world.”The graduate student studied the definition of schizophrenia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and, over time, worried that she was inadvertently bending her own behavior to better fit the bounds of that category. She became self-conscious about the experience of thinking and began to wonder if she heard a soft voice behind each thought, until she felt she was hearing voices, a symptom of the disorder. She was no longer sure what was her authentic experience and what had been suggested to her by experts.Over the course of their treatment, the patients at these clinics learned new ways of explaining why their lives had changed. They began to use terms like “brain disease” and “chemical imbalance.” Expert explanations replaced their idiosyncratic attempts to make sense of the world. One patient, who suffered from delusions about publicly humiliating himself, told me, “The hippocampus is firing too much and telling me to be afraid.” Another said, “It’s the adrenaline, the epinephrine, and the norepinephrine; and the amygdala can either heighten the anxiety or diminish it, depending on which direction I take with my thoughts.”When these patients could recognize that their unusual experiences were symptoms stemming from disorders in their brains, they were said to have “insight” — a pivotal, almost magical word in psychiatry. In a seminal 1934 paper in The British Journal of Medical Psychology, the psychiatrist Aubrey Lewis defined insight as the “correct attitude to a morbid change in oneself.” A patient with the “correct attitude” understands, for instance, that the spirits of dead people are not suddenly talking to her, that the voices she hears are symptoms that medication can silence. Insight looms large in decisions about whether to hospitalize people against their will, and it is assessed nearly every time a patient enters a psychiatrist’s office.But the “correct attitude” may depend on culture, race, ethnicity and faith. Studies show that people of color tend to be rated as lacking in insight more than those who are white, perhaps because doctors find their modes of expressing distress unfamiliar, or because these patients have less reason to trust what their doctors say. In the starkest terms, insight measures the degree to which a patient agrees with her doctor.The correct attitude is also historically contingent. Fifty years ago, at the height of the psychoanalytic era, a patient was said to have insight if she could recognize, say, her repressed hatred for her mother and the way that emotion had structured her life. But by the 1990s, psychoanalytic theories fell out of favor and the correct attitude came to rest on a new body of knowledge: Mental illness was seen as a neurobiological problem, and people had insight if they understood that they had disorders of the brain. After the surgeon general’s first ever report on mental health, in 1999, which was focused on reducing the stigma of mental illness, the surgeon general announced that there is “no longer any scientific justification for distinguishing between mental illness and other forms of illness,” in part because both had biological causes.But while a biological framework has alleviated some kinds of stigma, it has exacerbated others. A recent meta-analysis of 26 studies concluded that people who saw mental illness as fundamentally biological or genetic were less likely to blame mental conditions on weak character or to respond in punitive ways, but more likely to view a person’s illness as uncontrollable, alienating and dangerous. The disease came to be seen as static and unyielding, a strike of lightning that couldn’t be redirected. In her memoir “The Center Cannot Hold,” Elyn Saks, a professor of law, psychology and psychiatry at the University of Southern California, wrote that when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia she felt as if she were “being told that whatever had gone wrong inside my head was permanent and, from all indications, unfixable. Repeatedly, I ran up against words like ‘debilitating’, ‘baffling,’ ‘chronic,’ ‘catastrophic,’ ‘devastating’ and ‘loss.’”In creating a shared language, contemporary psychiatry can alleviate people’s loneliness and make frightening experiences legible and communicable, but we may take for granted the impact of its explanations, which are not neutral: They alter the kinds of explanations that count as “insight,” and how we expect our lives to unfold. Psychiatrists still know little about why some people with mental illnesses can lead fulfilling, functional lives and others with the same diagnoses feel as if they are defined and disabled by illness. Answering the question, I think, requires paying more attention to the distance between the psychiatric explanations for illness and the individual stories and languages through which people find meaning themselves. Even if questions of interpretation are secondary to finding effective medical treatment, these stories change people’s lives, sometimes in unpredictable ways, and bear heavily on a person’s sense of self — and the desire to be treated at all. When newly diagnosed people lack insight, this might be because of the severity of the illness, but it may also be because they don’t want to cede control over their identities. Though psychiatrists have worked to pay more attention to the perspectives of patients in recent years, they sometimes treat signs of mental illness without regard for whether they are the source of a person’s distress.Naomi Gaines-Young, who became a mother as a teenager and whom I interviewed for many months for my book, told me that when she developed psychosis she didn’t accept that she had a mental illness, because the concept seemed so far removed from the substance of what she was going through. When she was in an unmedicated state, she said, “I felt I was being shown things that were being hidden from me all my life about the reality of me as a Black woman in America raising children.” Ms. Gaines-Young wanted to talk with her doctors about the disapproving looks that people gave her and her babies on the street, but when her doctors reinterpreted these experiences as symptoms of bipolar disorder, it intensified her sense that reality could not be trusted. In her medical records, a doctor wrote, “insight is nonexistent.” To have a new explanatory framework foisted onto one’s life is not always healing or generative. It can also feel diminishing, a blow to one’s sense of self. “Where is the sensitive side of psychiatry?” Ms. Gaines-Young said. “They missed the mark. The doctors’ lack of knowledge about who I am and where I come from pushed me farther and farther away.”Ms. Gaines-Young ended up incarcerated for a crime she committed when she was psychotic, and she became close with a prison librarian with whom she discussed the books she was reading each week. She felt grounded by a deep connection to another person, and when she was sick, she trusted the librarian’s assessment of her state of mind. When, after going off psychiatric drugs, the librarian told her, “I don’t fully recognize you,” Ms. Gaines-Young decided to start taking medications again. “She knew me intellectually, philosophically, and even on some level spiritually,” she said. “She was a huge barometer to judge my wellness and non-wellness.” Ms. Gaines-Young went on: “She wasn’t treating me like a problem to be fixed only with medication. She understood the language I was speaking.”Rachel Aviv is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of the book “Strangers to Ourselves: Unsettled Minds and the Stories That Make Us,” from which this essay is adapted.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>DeSantis’s Migrant Flights Aim to Jolt Midterms, and Lay Groundwork for 2024</title>
	<author>Michael C. Bender</author>
	<body>For months, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas and Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona have been busing migrants across the country, using immigrants as political props as they try to score points in the midterm elections and bolster their conservative bona fides.But last week, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, supercharged the tactic, flying two chartered planeloads of undocumented migrants out of Texas — about 700 miles from the Florida state line — to Martha’s Vineyard, the moneyed Massachusetts vacation spot frequented by liberal celebrities and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.The migrants had not set foot in Florida and said they were misled about their destination. The island was unprepared to handle the influx. But Mr. DeSantis got exactly the reaction he wanted.Liberal condemnation. Conservative applause. And national attention.Days after the migrants got off their planes, Mr. DeSantis flew across the country himself — to events for Republican candidates for governor in Wisconsin and Kansas where he promoted his stunt. He received standing ovations.“They were homeless,” he said about the migrants, at an event on Sunday in Green Bay, Wis. “They were hungry. And they hit the jackpot to be able to be in the wealthiest sanctuary city in the world.”The ambitious governor is betting that the tactic will not hurt his re-election race in Florida, long the nation’s largest political battleground, and will reinject the issue of border security into the midterm contest. As voters remain focused on economic uncertainty and abortion rights, it remains unclear whether immigration will gain a major foothold in the final weeks before the election in November.Yet the move signals that Mr. DeSantis could be eyeing a future beyond Florida and aiming to secure his place in the conversation of potential presidential candidates. Polls show that former President Donald J. Trump is the party’s overwhelming pick in 2024, with Mr. DeSantis as the clear second choice.“This is a sign of someone who is acting with political impunity because he believes he has political impunity in Florida,” said Fernand R. Amandi, a Democratic pollster in Miami. “I don’t think he makes this move if he didn’t already anticipate it was not a roadblock to him winning re-election.”Long considered to harbor presidential ambitions, Mr. DeSantis ripped this move directly from the playbook of Mr. Trump, whose rhetoric and political style he has adopted.The idea of transporting migrants to Democratic strongholds was considered by the Trump administration. Stephen Miller, the former president’s policy adviser, and others in the Trump White House pushed the move as a way to strike back against sanctuary cities that refused to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The plan was rejected by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials over liability and budgetary concerns.Mr. DeSantis secured $12 million in the state budget to transport unauthorized immigrants planning to come to Florida, an amount that suggested more flights are to come. He said the migrants had to sign a release form and had been given an informational packet that included a map of Martha’s Vineyard.But Mr. DeSantis has also been clear that the effort was part of a political strategy intended to lift his party in the midterms. Republican strategists say he and the other governors are simply pointing out the hypocrisy of Democratic Party leaders, whom they see as far removed from the surge of migrants and their impact on local communities.How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.A spokeswoman for Mr. DeSantis declined to comment for this article.The public investigations of Mr. Trump and the fight over the fate of legal abortion heightened Democratic hopes for the midterms over the summer, leaving Republicans scrambling to return the race to issues that break more in their favor — high inflation, economic uncertainty, public safety, immigration.Polling shows that a majority of voters — 51 percent — say they agree more with the Republican Party than the Democrats on illegal immigration, according to a new poll by The New York Times and Siena College. On the issue of legal immigration, they are evenly split.“This border is now an issue in these elections,” Mr. DeSantis said on Sunday, at the event in Wisconsin. “And I think it’s something that our candidates need to take.”Democrats moved quickly to cast Mr. DeSantis as heartless and “un-American.”“Instead of working with us on solutions, Republicans are playing politics with human beings, using them as props,” President Biden said on Thursday at the Hispanic Caucus Institute Gala in Washington. “What they’re doing is simply wrong. It’s un-American, it’s reckless and we have a process in place to manage migrants at the border.”The Democrat who is Mr. DeSantis’s opponent in the Florida governor’s race, former Representative Charlie Crist, released a digital ad calling the migrant flights “a cruel political stunt to appeal to his base.”“My faith teaches me that we’re all children of God,” Mr. Crist said in the ad. “That is lost on Ron DeSantis. For him, it’s always putting politics over peoples’ lives.”Democrats see an opportunity in part because the migrants he sent to Martha’s Vineyard were overwhelmingly from Venezuela. Florida is home to the largest population of Venezuelan immigrants in the country. And Venezuelan voters are an important demographic in the perennial swing state that helped cement Mr. Trump’s victory in the state in the 2020 election.But Mr. DeSantis’s move suggests that he believes his re-election effort is operating from such a position of strength that he can afford to potentially repel some moderates in his state, a longtime destination for immigrants.Some strategists say the governor may not be focused on swing voters in his home state at all.“My guess is that it seems pretty favorable, at least in terms of the one audience he has right now, which is Republican voters,” said Ed Goeas, a longtime Republican strategist.</body>

	<title>At Windsor, the queen will be interred with her husband, who died last year.</title>
	<author>Mark Landler</author>
	<body>LONDON — Shortly before 4 p.m., Queen Elizabeth II’s coffin will arrive at Windsor, the turreted castle where she spent most of her final days, quarantining during the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2021, she buried Philip, her husband of 73 years, in an austere funeral at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor that was memorable for poignant images of the queen, isolated and masked, as she sat alone in a choir stall.But this funeral will see full pomp and pageantry as the hearse rolls up the tree-lined vista known as the Long Walk. Once inside the chapel, there will be yet another service. At its end, the imperial state crown, the orb and the scepter — gleaming symbols of the monarchy — will be taken from the queen’s coffin, where they have sat since last Wednesday, and placed on the altar.With that bit of imperial business completed, the coffin will be lowered into the royal vault, and the television cameras switched off. Her interment, next to Philip, in the King George VI Memorial Chapel, is a private ceremony for her family.</body>

	<title>The Second Coming of the Appletini</title>
	<author>Robert Simonson</author>
	<body>In April, a bar called Martiny’s — pronounced like the drink — opened near Gramercy Park in Manhattan. As one might expect from a place named after the world’s most famous cocktail, there is a martini on the menu. It is purple.That signature cocktail — the Grand Martiny’s — is made of gin, manzanilla sherry, port wine, elderflower liqueur and Cognac. It’s a twist on a 50-50 martini from Takuma Watanabe, the cocktail bar’s beverage director and a founder. “I love martinis,” he said.He has company. These days, New York and other major cities are awash in martinis, many of them straying far from the traditional template. Speculation within the industry on the source of the drink’s ascent varies: There’s the nostalgia for a simpler era, the sharpening of drinkers’ palates thanks to Covid-era home bartending and, of course, the need for a stiff drink in hard times. The popularity of the espresso martini, too, cannot be discounted, if only for keeping the word martini in constant circulation.Every new bar or restaurant seems to offer a special martini. And just as in the so-called ’tini era of the 1990s — when anything in a conical glass sported the name martini, no matter the ingredients — many don’t stop at one.The martinis at Chezchez, an airy aperitivo-style bar that opened last fall in San Francisco, include the Coastal Martini, made of aquavit, sherry and vermouth. At Sweet Liberty in Miami, the martini list is six drinks long, with modern versions of ’90s staples like the lychee martini and the lemon drop.Oui Cocktail Lounge, a new bar in Flatbush, Brooklyn, also has a lemon drop riff, made with vodka, sherry and lemon cordial. Little Ned, which recently opened in the old NoMad space in the Flatiron district, has a vodka-based Champagne martini made with Lillet Blanc and a Champagne reduction, and an Everything Martini, a gin-vodka blend flavored with a roasted-allium tincture and garnished with mozzarella balls.It’s enough to make you take all the talk of a 1990s revival seriously. Are we living through a new ’tini era?“I think it’s a much more refined ’tini era, if it is,” said Chris Moore, the beverage director of the Ned NoMad, the hotel and members’ club that contains Little Ned.Mr. Moore, whose résumé includes stints at Coupette in London and Dante in Manhattan, is among the seasoned cocktail bartenders leading this explosion of variegated martinis. He recalls how the craft-cocktail community, which arose in the early 2000s, rejected the syrupy horrors of martinis past. Now, however, he is all in on martini experimentation.“I quite like the idea of taking a classic twist on a martini and twisting it again,” he said. “Now I see the reinvention of the apple martini.”Julie Reiner, a leader in the craft-cocktail business for two decades, has tried to improve the appletini more than once. She first attracted attention in 2000 at the Greenwich Village restaurant C3 for her improved version of that ’90s bar staple, which used apple-infused vodka, apple liqueur and sparkling cider. When her new SoHo bar Milady’s opens this fall, she’ll serve apple martinis that are even better. Her latest version contains apple-infused gin and vodka, as well as apple brandy and apple liqueur.She thinks the martini’s resurgence is driven in large part by nostalgia. “And there’s something to be said for those flavors,” she said. “A lot of people want to drink martinis, but a classic martini is too strong for them.”The critical differences between yesterday’s and today’s creative martinis are skill and ingredients. While the old martinis were mostly made of vodka and cloying liqueurs, today’s bartenders insist on higher-quality spirits and a drier touch.“It’s not just any random ingredient served in a martini glass,” said Sam Ross, an owner of Attaboy, who last year helped reopen Temple Bar in NoHo, which offers nearly a dozen martinis. “This time around, it’s based around clear spirits stirred with wine-based products,” he said, in the same way that the classic martini mixes clear gin or vodka with vermouth.Mr. Ross pointed out that 20 years ago, bartenders didn’t have access to the wide variety of vermouths, sherries and other wine-based spirits imported today. This allows for a wider array of martinis that are nonetheless closer to the classic model than to the sweet potions of the ’90s.The martini-thirsty public has also played a part in creating this expanding martini universe. Ashley Santoro, the beverage director of Deux Chats, which opened in July, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knew her customers were going to order standard martinis anyway. There was no point in listing a classic version on the menu. The two martinis available are the Deux Chats Martini, made with gin, vermouth, sherry and celery brine; and the Kinky Martini, made with red-thai-chile-infused vodka, a chile liqueur and two aperitifs.If the cocktail revival of the past two decades has been a history of bartenders trying to correct bad practices and misunderstood cocktails, perhaps the new ’tinis are the ultimate correction, taking a chapter of cocktail history that had been written off as a train wreck and rewriting it as a creative embroidering on a classic.Naren Young, the creative director of Sweet Liberty, sees value in making a great version of something that is often made poorly. “Maybe I can drink a good apple martini,” he said. “Maybe I can have a great lemon drop. There’s nothing wrong with it if it’s done well.”Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest. Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice.</body>

	<title>Pentagon Orders Review of Its Overseas Social Media Campaigns</title>
	<author>Sheera Frenkel</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — White House officials told the military that they were concerned about its efforts to spread pro-American messaging on social media, prompting the Pentagon to order a review of secretive operations to influence populations overseas, U.S. officials said.The review follows a decision by Twitter and Facebook over the summer to shut down misleading accounts that they determined were sending messages about U.S. foreign policy interests abroad.The Pentagon audit and White House concerns were first reported by The Washington Post.Disinformation researchers said the campaigns largely fell into two camps. Most of the campaigns spread pro-American messages, including memes and slogans that praised the United States. Those programs were similar to how Beijing often spreads disinformation by seeding positive messages about life in China.One campaign targeting Iran, however, spread divisive messages about life there. The accounts involved pushed out views that both supported and opposed the Iranian government. That disinformation effort resembled the methods used by Russia to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.For years U.S. military commands have promoted pro-American news and messages for audiences overseas, sometimes earning the scrutiny of Congress. But the decision by the social media companies to shut down some accounts associated with the military suggested that the activity had gone further.Twitter and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, removed accounts that they said violated their terms of service by taking part in “coordinated inauthentic behavior.”A report in August by Stanford University’s Internet Observatory and the social media analytics firm Graphika said those accounts were pushing pro-American messages in the Middle East and Central Asia. The two groups attributed some of the accounts taken down by Facebook and Twitter to the Trans-Regional Web Initiative, a more than 10-year-old Pentagon initiative that sends out information in support of the United States in areas where the U.S. military operates.The postings varied widely in sophistication. Some of the more polished work was aimed at Twitter and Telegram users in Iran and pushed a wide variety of views. While most of the messages were critical of the Iranian government, researchers said others were supportive of it, the kind of activity that could potentially be designed to inflame debate and sow divisions in the country.Several American officials said the suspended accounts were affiliated with the U.S. military, though they did not say whether any efforts were meant to spread information in Iran.The program evoked the propaganda campaigns that authoritarian governments have used to push messages at home and abroad. But disinformation experts say they were not very successful. Most of the posts received only a “handful” of likes or retweets, researchers noted, and only 19 percent of the accounts that were identified had over 1,000 followers.Previous influence operations backed by nation-states on social networks have been attributed mainly to Russia, China, Iran and other adversaries of the United States.Russia pioneered many of these online disinformation tactics, using Facebook, Twitter and other social networks to spread divisive messaging. Some of the country’s earliest efforts were aimed at spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda in Eastern Europe. Countries worldwide have mimicked Russia’s techniques.Over the past eight years, Facebook has named over a dozen countries that have created Russian-styled disinformation efforts, including Iran, Sudan and Nicaragua. The company now publishes monthly reports in which it describes new disinformation campaigns it has uprooted.China has also used Facebook and Twitter to burnish its image and to undercut accusations of human rights abuses.The Trans-Regional Web Initiative began as an effort by the Special Operations Command in 2008. Over time, U.S. Central Command and other military headquarters also began sending out truthful but pro-American messaging. Central Command’s efforts began with websites that posted news stories aimed at audiences in North Africa and the Middle East.After a critical report by the Government Accountability Office, Congress passed a defense authorization bill in 2013 calling for the initiative not to be funded the following year. Pentagon officials declined to answer questions about the initiative on Monday.Still, other information operations have continued on social media platforms.In the wake of the Stanford report, some U.S. officials briefed on the program disputed that the accounts were inauthentic, saying that some of the profile pages of the accounts noted that they were affiliated with Central Command.But it is not clear how many of the accounts had such a disclosure, or if there was a broader effort to hide their military connection.White House officials were concerned that Pentagon policy for information operations was too broad and that clandestine programs could undermine American credibility, even if the material being pushed was accurate, the administration official said.In a statement, Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the top Pentagon spokesman, said it was the Department of Defense’s policy to conduct information operations in support of “national security priorities.”“These activities must be undertaken in compliance with U.S. law and D.O.D. policy,” General Ryder said. “We are committed to enforcing those safeguards.”Julian E. Barnes reported from Washington, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco. Eric Schmitt and Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.</body>

	<title>¿Es cierto que el ejercicio fortalece el sistema inmunitario?</title>
	<author>Knvul Sheikh</author>
	<body>Seguro que has escuchado este consejo: una de las mejores cosas que puedes hacer para mantenerte sano —sobre todo cuando se acerca la temporada de resfriados y gripe— es estar físicamente activo.Esta sabiduría popular existe desde hace mucho tiempo, pero hasta hace poco los investigadores no disponían de muchos datos que respaldaran esa recomendación. Ahora, los científicos que estudian los factores de riesgo relacionados con la COVID-19 han encontrado algunos indicios preliminares sobre la relación entre el ejercicio regular y unas mejores defensas inmunitarias contra las enfermedades.Cuando los investigadores analizaron 16 estudios de personas que se mantuvieron físicamente activas durante la pandemia, descubrieron que hacer ejercicio estaba asociado con un menor riesgo de infección, así como con una menor probabilidad de padecer por las complicaciones producidas por la covid. El análisis, publicado en julio en The British Journal of Sports Medicine, ha generado un gran entusiasmo entre los científicos del ejercicio, quienes afirman que los hallazgos podrían generar directrices actualizadas sobre la actividad física y las políticas sanitarias que consideren el ejercicio como medicina.Los expertos que estudian la inmunología y las enfermedades infecciosas son más cautos al interpretar los resultados. Pero están de acuerdo en que el ejercicio ayuda a proteger la salud a través de varios mecanismos diferentes.Desde hace décadas, los científicos han observado que las personas que están en forma y son físicamente activas parecen tener tasas más bajas de infecciones en las vías respiratorias. Además, cuando las personas que hacen ejercicio se enferman, tienden a padecer una enfermedad menos grave, comentó David Nieman, profesor de Ciencias de la Salud y del Ejercicio en la Universidad Estatal de los Apalaches, que no participó en la reciente revisión sobre la covid.“El riesgo de complicaciones y mortalidad por el resfriado común, la influenza y la neumonía disminuyen bastante”, afirmó Nieman. “Lo llamo el efecto como de vacuna”.El nuevo metanálisis, que analizó los estudios realizados entre noviembre de 2019 y marzo de 2022, encontró que este efecto se extiende a la covid. Las personas de todo el mundo que hacían ejercicio con regularidad tuvieron un 36 por ciento menos de riesgo de hospitalización y un 43 por ciento menos de riesgo de muerte por la covid en comparación con los que no eran activos. También presentaron una menor probabilidad de contraer la covid en general.Las personas que siguieron las recomendaciones de hacer al menos 150 minutos de actividad moderada o 75 minutos de actividad vigorosa por semana parecieron obtener el mayor beneficio. Pero incluso los que hacían menos ejercicio estaban más protegidos contra la enfermedad que los que no hacían nada.Los investigadores sostienen la teoría de que el ejercicio puede ayudar a combatir las bacterias y virus infecciosos al aumentar la circulación de las células inmunitarias en la sangre, por ejemplo. En algunos estudios pequeños, los investigadores también descubrieron que la contracción y movimiento de los músculos liberan proteínas de señalización conocidas como citoquinas, las cuales ayudan a dirigir las células inmunitarias para encontrar y combatir la infección.Aunque los niveles de citoquinas y células inmunitarias disminuyan dos o tres horas después de que dejas de hacer ejercicio, explicó Nieman, tu sistema inmunitario se vuelve más receptivo y capaz de atrapar patógenos con mayor rapidez si te ejercitas todos los días. “Tu sistema inmunitario está preparado y se encuentra en mejor forma para enfrentar una carga viral en cualquier momento dado”, indicó.En los seres humanos sanos, la actividad física también se ha relacionado con una menor inflamación crónica. La inflamación generalizada puede ser muy perjudicial e incluso hacer que las propias células inmunitarias ataquen el organismo. La inflamación es un factor de riesgo conocido para la covid, señaló Nieman. También indicó que, por lo tanto, es lógico que la reducción de la inflamación mejore las posibilidades de combatir la infección.La investigación también muestra que el ejercicio puede amplificar los beneficios de algunas vacunas. Por ejemplo, las personas que hicieron ejercicio justo después de recibir la vacuna de la COVID-19 parece que produjeron más anticuerpos. Y en estudios de adultos mayores que se vacunaron a principios de la temporada de gripe, los que hicieron ejercicio tuvieron anticuerpos que les duraron todo el invierno.El ejercicio proporciona una serie de bondades para la salud que ayudan a reducir la incidencia y la gravedad de las enfermedades, afirma Stuart Ray, especialista en enfermedades infecciosas de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Johns Hopkins.Se sabe que incorporar a la rutina una caminata, un trote, una salida al gimnasio o el deporte de tu elección ayuda a reducir la obesidad, la diabetes y las enfermedades cardiacas, por ejemplo, todos los cuales son factores de riesgo para las complicaciones producidas por la influenza y la covid. Hacer ejercicio puede ayudarte a tener un sueño más reparador, mejorar tu estado de ánimo y optimizar el metabolismo de la insulina, así como tu salud cardiovascular, lo que mejora tus posibilidades en la lucha contra la gripe y la covid. Es difícil saber, según Ray, si los beneficios provienen de cambios directos en el sistema inmunitario o simplemente de una mejor salud en general.Peter Chin-Hong, especialista en enfermedades infecciosas de la Universidad de California en San Francisco, estuvo de acuerdo en que se necesitan más investigaciones antes de que los científicos logren identificar un mecanismo específico o un vínculo causal. Mientras tanto, dijo, es importante no confiar demasiado en eso.“Por ahora, no podemos decir: ‘Iré al gimnasio para evitar contraer la covid’”, dijo Chin-Hong. El problema de estudiar el efecto preciso de la actividad física sobre la inmunidad es que el ejercicio no es algo que los científicos puedan medir fácilmente en una escala lineal, dijo Ray. “La gente hace ejercicio de muchas maneras distintas”.Los participantes del estudio suelen reportar la cantidad y la intensidad de su ejercicio, lo que a menudo puede ser inexacto. Y solo esperar que el ejercicio sea beneficioso puede proporcionar un poderoso efecto placebo. Como resultado, puede ser difícil para los investigadores saber exactamente cuánto ejercicio o qué tipo es ideal para la función inmunitaria. También es muy posible que las personas que hacen ejercicio con regularidad compartan otros atributos que les ayuden a combatir las infecciones, como una dieta variada o un mejor acceso a la atención médica, dijo Ray.Más allá de eso, “existe un gran debate sobre si hacer demasiado ejercicio te hace más susceptible a infecciones y enfermedades”, dijo Richard Simpson, quien estudia fisiología e inmunología del ejercicio en la Universidad de Arizona.Los corredores de maratón a menudo informan que se enferman después de las carreras, dijo Simpson, y algunos investigadores creen que hacer demasiado ejercicio vigoroso podría sobreestimular inadvertidamente las citocinas y la inflamación en el cuerpo. Hacer ejercicio sin descanso también agota las reservas de glucógeno del cuerpo, lo que para algunas personas podría provocar un deterioro de la función inmunológica durante unas horas o unos días, dependiendo de su estado de salud inicial, dijo. Y hacer ejercicio en grupos o asistir a campamentos de entrenamiento deportivo intenso podría exponer a los atletas a más patógenos. Otros expertos señalan que las personas que son físicamente activas podrían simplemente hacer un seguimiento más cercano de su estado de salud.Sin embargo, para el deportista promedio, los datos preliminares sugieren que puede haber un efecto protector contra las enfermedades graves. Pero quienes tienen problemas para hacer suficiente ejercicio o quienes por algún motivo no pueden ejercitarse para nada no deben desesperarse, dijo Ray. “Lo que ayuda a una persona a mantenerse saludable en comparación con otra es una combinación compleja de factores”.</body>

	<title>Do Antidepressants Work for Severe PMS?</title>
	<author>Rachel Rabkin Peachman</author>
	<body>Q. During the two weeks before my period every month, I get premenstrual symptoms so severe that they are seriously affecting my work, social life and romantic life. I’ve heard that S.S.R.I. antidepressants can help, but should I really go on meds for something so cyclical?Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD, is a much more severe but less common form of premenstrual syndrome (or PMS) that can be tricky to diagnose. It’s characterized by a slew of psychological and physical symptoms — irritability, despair, anxiety, appetite changes, lethargy, trouble sleeping, bloating, headache — many of which can be mistaken for other health problems, like regular PMS, thyroid issues, depression or bipolar disorder.What differentiates PMDD symptoms from those other ailments, though, is their timing and severity, said Crystal Edler Schiller, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and associate director of behavior therapy and reproductive science at the university’s Center for Women’s Mood Disorders.PMDD symptoms only occur during the two weeks before menstruation begins, and resolve within a few days after it starts, Dr. Schiller said. And unlike PMS, PMDD’s symptoms are typically so severe that they interfere with daily life. “You may go from feeling like your usual self and then feeling like you’re coming out of your skin, uncomfortable, irritable, not able to function normally in social situations, at work and at home,” she said. “When it’s at its most severe, it can be really debilitating.”Despite its severity, PMDD is “still seen as a fringe diagnosis,” Dr. Schiller added, since it was only recognized as a distinct disorder in 2013, and not all health care providers have experience with it or know how to spot it. “So many of our patients say, ‘I feel alone in this’ or ‘I feel crazy and no one recognizes it,’” she said.To get an accurate diagnosis, a health care provider — typically a psychiatrist or an obstetrician-gynecologist — will ask you to track and rate your symptoms every day for two to three months. In Dr. Schiller’s clinic, “about a third of people who think they have PMDD don’t actually have it once we do the prospective ratings,” she explained. So it’s critical to work with a knowledgeable doctor before jumping to conclusions or treatment plans.If you’ve established that you have PMDD, there are effective treatment options. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors — or S.S.R.I. antidepressants, which are thought to treat depression and anxiety by increasing the availability of the chemical messenger serotonin in the brain — are some of the first options health care providers suggest.Scientists haven’t yet figured out why some people develop PMDD and others don’t. They do know that the disorder, which can emerge at any point during childbearing years, is caused by the fluctuation of hormones during the last 14 days of the menstrual cycle, called the luteal phase, said Dr. Kristina Deligiannidis, the director of women’s behavioral health at Northwell Health’s Zucker Hillside Hospital in New York. “We don’t know if it’s the drop in estrogen during the luteal phase or the dramatic rise in progesterone,” she added. “But it could be some combination of the two things.”Large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials — the most rigorous types of studies — have found that low doses of S.S.R.I.s, taken during just the last two weeks of the menstrual cycle, can greatly alleviate PMDD symptoms. In one study published in 2005, for instance, researchers asked 373 women with PMDD to take a pill for each of the 14 days before menstruation for three months: One group took 12.5 milligrams of the antidepressant paroxetine CR (Paxil-CR), a second group took 25 milligrams of the same medication, and the third group took a placebo. Of the 292 women who completed the trial, those in the antidepressant groups tolerated the drugs and reported significantly reduced symptoms of PMDD, with no major differences between the two doses.“As long as you keep track of where you are in your cycle, that works really well,” Dr. Deligiannidis said. Sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat PMDD, but numerous trials of other S.S.R.I.s — like citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro) and fluvoxamine (Luvox) — have shown benefits, too.Why these antidepressants are effective is still a bit of a mystery, Dr. Deligiannidis said. “We know that S.S.R.I.s must be working a little bit differently than how they work for depression or anxiety disorders,” she said, since their benefits for those conditions can take weeks to kick in while for PMDD, symptoms can be relieved within days.If you have PMDD and are already taking S.S.R.I.s, your doctor may recommend that you increase the dosage during just the lead-up to menstruation.Not every treatment works for everyone, but fortunately, there are other options to try.Birth control. For those who don’t respond well to S.S.R.I.s or who don’t want to take them, oral contraceptives containing estrogen and synthetic progesterone have been shown to alleviate symptoms. “The goal of using an oral contraceptive is to keep the hormone levels stable day to day,” Dr. Schiller said. But women must take the pill continuously throughout the month (which means skipping the placebo pills at the end of the menstrual cycle) so that they don’t experience a period or the change in hormones that triggers their symptoms.Yaz is the only contraceptive that is F.D.A.-approved for treating PMDD, but Dr. Schiller said that other oral contraceptives can be effective, too. It just may take some trial and error to figure out the right one for you.Cognitive behavioral therapy. For those who want to avoid medication al‌together, some research suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of talk therapy that focuses on reframing negative thoughts and behaviors, can lessen PMDD and PMS symptoms‌. “The research on C.B.T. therapy is promising,” said Dr. Teresa Lanza di Scalea, a psychiatrist specializing in women’s reproductive mental health and an affiliate faculty member at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.Though keep in mind that C.B.T. alone is typically not enough to ease severe PMDD symptoms. In such cases, doctors might recommend it in combination with medication.Lifestyle changes. Prioritizing exercise, sticking with a consistent sleep schedule and reducing stress as much as possible during the weeks before your period can also help, Dr. Lanza di Scalea said. “I’ve found these lifestyle changes, which do take effort, can feel very empowering for women.”As with C.B.T., lifestyle changes can only go so far in alleviating severe cases of PMDD on their own, but they can supplement other treatments.Calcium. There is also some limited evidence that taking certain supplements, particularly calcium, may lessen PMDD symptoms. Though the supplements may not work in severe cases, they may be worth trying. “If women are not taking a multivitamin with calcium, I usually have them start that,” Dr. Schiller said about her patients with PMDD.Injectable medications. If none of these options quell your symptoms, your doctor may suggest that you consider an injectable medication called leuprolide acetate (Lupron Depot), which can be used off-label to treat PMDD. This medication, which can be given once a month or every three months, stops the ovaries from producing estrogen and progesterone, which can eliminate monthly symptoms.For some women, it can make a “huge difference in terms of mood and ability to function,” Dr. Schiller said. The downside: It may not be sustainable in the long term because it’s expensive — around $2,000 (or more) per injection, she said — and insurance often doesn’t cover it. It can also cause side effects like headache, fever and muscle aches.Surgery. If you have exhausted all other treatments for PMDD, the last option is to remove the ovaries. While extreme, Dr. Schiller said, many patients have success with this surgery.“It’s a matter of finding a provider who will work with you to find a treatment that works,” she added.</body>

	<title>Put Two and Two Together</title>
	<author>Rachel Fabi</author>
	<body>TUESDAY PUZZLE — Well, well, well, what do we have here? A puzzle by Rebecca Goldstein and some other constructor whose name sounds awfully familiar. That’s right, in an alignment of circumstances I have been anxiously anticipating, today I face the enormous challenge of writing about a puzzle that I, your intrepid Wordplay columnist, co-constructed.Rather than pretend that I can write an objective analysis of this puzzle, I want to use this space to let solvers in on the behind-the-scenes process of creating a themed crossword collaboratively, from the germ of a theme idea to a fully clued grid. I’m using today’s puzzle as my example, so be warned that today this section abounds with spoilers.Lucky for me, my collaborator today is one of the best in the business — Rebecca has a mind for themes like no one else. I get texts from her on a near-daily basis with bits of wordplay accompanied by her favorite question: “Is this anything?” What she means is: “Can we generate more bits of wordplay like this one to create a theme set?” Usually this is followed by a lengthy back-and-forth in which we propose actual and joke theme entries that could form a cohesive set.Today’s puzzle has a slightly different origin story, in that Rebecca actually tweeted out “Is this … anything?” to the whole world, and I immediately texted her that yes, it’s a thing, and we should build a puzzle around it!The theme, which we referred to as “triple word score” and, alternatively, “retriplication,” involves repeating a word in a reduplicative phrase to create a wacky new phrase that uses the same word three times.Once we confirmed that the kernel of an idea could, in fact, be a thing, Rebecca and I created a shared document where we collected all of the possible theme entries we could brainstorm and the enumerations of their lengths. Their lengths are important because a theme set in a rotationally symmetrical puzzle (like this one, and like most New York Times Crosswords) needs to have theme entries of matching lengths that can be placed into the grid in positions “opposite” one another. If there’s an odd number of theme entries, there can be one outlier without another entry that matches its length.Rebecca and I sifted through our list together to identify a final set of symmetrical entries from a lonnnnnnng list of candidates. Some of my favorites that ended up on the cutting room floor include BAO BAO BAO (“Dumplings for the National Zoo’s baby panda?”) and GOODY GOODY GOODY (“Treat for a teacher’s pet?”).Once a final set has been chosen, one collaborator will create the initial layout of the grid. For today’s puzzle, that person was me. Because TUT TUT TUT is nine letters long, I placed it opposite CAN CAN CAN (which is also nine letters). CHOW CHOW CHOW and ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM are 12s, so they are opposite each other in the grid. With the theme entries in place, I set the black squares and filled half the grid on a diagonal through the puzzle (which is pretty normal for splitting a rotationally symmetrical grid). I sent the half-filled puzzle to Rebecca so that she could fill the second half.After completing a grid that we both loved, we created another shared document that listed all of the entries in the puzzle in one column, followed by a column apiece where each of us could contribute clues. We met via Zoom to hang out and slowly fill in the document together, hopping independently around the list and pausing occasionally to ask an opinion on a clue or laugh at a particularly witty bit of wordplay. Rebecca wrote some of my favorite clues in this puzzle, including “A little bit of everything” for ATOM and the echoed clue “Put(s) two and two together, e.g.” for ADDS and IDIOM. Of my own clues, I am particularly pleased with “Uninvited picnic guests” for ANTS and the various musical theater clues I managed to squeeze in.And there you have it: four easy steps to a collaborative crossword puzzle. All that remained was to send it to The New York Times! We submitted this puzzle on Aug. 25, 2021, and we heard back with a yes from the editorial team on Dec. 3, 2021.Since I’m sure you’ve heard enough from me, I’m leaving the constructor notes to Rebecca to tell her side of the story.Rebecca Goldstein: Theme ideas come from crazy places. When a friend texted me “Zoom zoom!” about her new car at the height of online hangouts last year, I did what any good theme-brain would do. I marched right over to Twitter and asked, “ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM (12) [Conference call for Mazda’s marketing team?] Is this … anything?” Rachel was pretty sure it was; she was right. Rachel also encouraged me to stop tweeting out theme ideas; she was right. So now I send them all to her.The New York Times Crossword has an open submission system, and you can submit your puzzles online.For tips on how to get started, read our series, “How to Make a Crossword Puzzle.”Almost finished solving, but need a bit more help?

	<title>To Really Understand the Ocean, We Need to Go Back in Time</title>
	<author>John Waldman</author>
	<body>Not that long ago the world’s oceans were viewed as too gargantuan for humans to influence. This view was voiced most notably in 1883 by the English biologist Thomas Huxley, who in his inaugural address to the International Fisheries Exhibition in London asserted that “all the great sea fisheries are inexhaustible.”Nowadays, such naïveté seems inconceivable. We’re witnessing rampant overfishing and the decline in size of commercially important fish; rising water temperatures and even “marine heat waves” that are throwing ecosystems into disarray and driving fish and crustacean stocks to the relief of deeper water and toward the poles; acidity that is challenging the ability of sea creatures to form shells; lessening oxygen levels and “dead zones”; contamination from oil spills — a gloomy totality that has come to be known as the “Aquacalypse.”The seemingly inexhaustible is becoming dangerously exhausted.I’m an aquatic conservation biologist at Queens College. Among the courses I teach is a graduate seminar on “historical ecology” in the context of marine conservation. My students become most absorbed not in the grim realities of the alarming present, which they take as a given, but by historical accounts of incredible abundance. For instance, in the 1500s, Europeans exploring Nova Scotia simply dropped baskets in near-shore waters and hauled up large cod. Spanish sailors near Cuba saw turtles “in such vast numbers that they covered the sea.” Travelers noted large whales “infinite in number,” “impossible to be counted.” River herring once ran up rivers from the sea to spawn in quantities that seemed “unbelievable, indeed, indescribable, as also incomprehensible.”Again and again, my students are astonished and in awe of just how much sea life has vanished. They are experiencing a reset from what is known as the “shifting baselines syndrome”: the notion that generations of environmental decline has steadily obscured our view of past plenitude and left us thinking that the environmental conditions in which we’ve grown up are normal. The danger of this warped perspective is that we become more willing to accept the world as it is without ever knowing what it was. With an environmentally degraded planet as our baseline, our conservation aspirations are already hobbled.Their reactions underscored for me the emerging importance of historical ecology in our efforts to conserve the natural world and allow it to replenish itself. Present-day fisheries, for instance, are still largely managed by biologists against baselines established through records from the second half of the 20th century. But a growing body of work shows that sea life had been compromised well before that time, often deeply so. Today, researchers can go back centuries and even millenniums to construct a more accurate understanding of healthy, resilient oceans.This work is generating surprising insights. Important findings have emerged through analyses based on simple sources such as old photographs, the logbooks of whalers, the diaries of missionaries and even pirates, oral histories, market receipts, restaurant menus, and archaeological and paleontological digs; and some sources as sophisticated as algorithms that can estimate population numbers going back thousands of years from contemporary DNA samples. The collective results, a signal of plenteous abundances, seem like evidence from another world.In the classroom, I would issue my students a challenge for the semester: Though we would mostly study the past, they should consider the trajectories of change and look to the future to predict whether our oceans will be recovering or become further degraded in 2050, a milepost probably marking the middle of their careers. Most were in their 20s and many were pursuing master’s degrees. They not only grasped the significance of the shifting baselines paradigm but also were experiencing a personal sense of loss, of the biotic richness they knew they would never witness.When our final meeting arrived, I polled the class, repeating my question: “Would the condition of the oceans be better or worse in 2050?” Fifteen years ago, when I first began leading this seminar, about half the students displayed guarded optimism. Since then there have been some successful protective measures to better regulate fisheries and cordon off and protect areas of the sea. But given the far weightier recent stream of negative news, not a single student in my most recent class believed the state of the oceans would improve by then.In “A Sand County Almanac,” the conservationist Aldo Leopold wrote, “One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds.” An ecological education focused on contemporary conditions can well enough describe present-day biodiversity, food webs and the interactions of organisms with their environment. But without knowledge of former biological wealth and productivity and an understanding of how healthy and resilient ecologies functioned, one remains oblivious to the injuries. To know the past is to know those wounds are gaping. Caring and its essential offspring, conservation, are born from that knowledge.The middle of this century is only three decades away — long enough to drive marine waters to deeper levels of degradation and defaunation, yet ample enough time to reverse these trends.My students’ astonishment and passion have shown me that historical ecology is a powerful tool. We must look backward to truly comprehend our losses — resetting those baselines — in order to move forward.John Waldman is a professor of biology at Queens College and the author of “Running Silver: Restoring Atlantic Rivers and Their Great Fish Migrations.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>This Acrobatic Hunting Trick Is Straight Out of the Spider-Verse</title>
	<author>Sam Jones</author>
	<body>Spiders have no shortage of strategies to capture their prey. Some hunt in packs, others set traps and some even mimic the pheromones of their prey’s mate. But even so, less than 1 percent of spider species go after ants. The six-legged insects are fierce, and many are venomous adversaries with sharp, hedge-trimmer-like mandibles.That’s why Alfonso Aceves-Aparicio, a behavioral biologist, was surprised one night during a walk home from Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, when he passed by a Eucalyptus tree.“I saw a reddish blob hanging off of the tree trunk,” he said. And as he got closer he realized it was an ant attached to the silk line of a much smaller spider. As Mr. Aceves-Aparicio circled the tree, he noticed more spiders that seemed to be waiting around.He picked an ant off the ground and placed it on the tree, where it began to move toward one of the spiders. When it got near the ant, the spider began moving frantically and, faster than a blink of an eye, was gone. Mr. Aceves-Aparicio thought the spider must have fallen off the tree, but then he noticed the ant hanging from the tree trunk, attached to a silk thread.Soon after this, Mr. Aceves-Aparicio shifted the focus of his research to Euryopis umbilicata spiders and their daring hunting behavior. He and colleagues detailed what they discovered about the Cirque du Soleil-worthy performance these spiders use to kill ants — acrobatics so impressive that the researchers nicknamed them “ant-slayers.” The work was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.To get an idea of how often these spiders preyed on ants, Mr. Aceves-Aparicio and colleagues collected silk-covered carcasses from a large group of Eucalyptus trees and found that, of 182 carcasses collected, 181 were ants, and over 90 percent of those ants were Camponotus consobrinus, also known as banded sugar ants.The researchers then placed banded sugar ants close to the spiders on Eucalyptus trees in that same area and recorded what they saw with high-speed video cameras. The researchers found that, when an ant was in close range or, more often, made contact with a spider, the spider would — in a matter of milliseconds — flip its body over the ant, attaching silk to it in the process.“It’s almost like an action movie stuntman,” said Marie Herberstein, a behavioral ecologist at Macquarie University and a co-author of the study. “Or like Spider-Man, pulling out the piece of silk and sticking it in the right spot before they continue to tumble.”After attaching their sticky silk, the spider would drop down, secured by the same silk line attached to the ant. Once back on the tree, the spider would circle the ant, entangling it further before biting it and carrying away its to-go meal. Of the 60 attacks recorded, the spider walked away with a meal 85 percent of the time — an extraordinary success rate in the animal kingdom, particularly when it comes to capturing ants. The feather-legged assassin bug, which also preys on ants in Australia, is triumphant less than 3 percent of the time.“They’re hurtling themselves into the jaws of an ant and doing this highly acrobatic, highly precise movement,” Dr. Herberstein said. “It’s so amazing how precise all of it is and how successful. There’s no hit or miss here. It’s all hit.”“It’s basically David versus Goliath,” said Saad Bhamla, a biomolecular engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was not part of the study but has studied ultrafast motion in spiders.He views spiders as nature’s engineers that design a range of “silk tools” — including webs and super sticky silk lines like those of the ant-slayers — to take down prey larger than themselves.Dr. Bhamla says humans don’t treat arachnids and insects “as being capable of building tools; we think of humans and primates being the ones doing it.” He added, “Now you have these spiders, which have come up with another way to go after these ants.”</body>

	<title>‘Serial’: Season 3</title>
	<author>Serial Productions</author>
	<body>Serial is heading back to court. This time, in Cleveland. Not for one extraordinary case; instead, Serial wanted to tackle the whole criminal justice system. To do so, we figured we’d need to look at something different: ordinary cases.So we did. Inside these ordinary cases we found the troubling machinery of the criminal justice system on full display. We chose Cleveland because we could record everywhere — courtrooms, back hallways, judges’ chambers, prosecutors’ offices. And then we followed those cases outside the building, into neighborhoods, into people’s houses and into prison.We watched how justice is calculated in cases of all sizes, from the smallest misdemeanor to the most serious felony. This season, we tell you the extraordinary stories of ordinary cases. One courthouse, week by week.In the first episode of Season 3 of “Serial,” Sarah Koenig considers a relatively simple court case in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland and serves as the setting for the season.A young woman, Anna, is charged with hitting a police officer during a frenzied bar brawl that began when she confronted some men who had been slapping her buttocks.The lawyers on both sides agree that the outcome is an example of the system working — a baseline of functional justice in Cuyahoga County. So how does it work out for Anna?County judges in Ohio have a lot of leeway — the discretion to interpret what punishment consists of, and what danger to the public looks like, for example.This episode presents a view of justice from inside one courtroom, that of Judge Daniel Gaul. His room, more than any other in the Cuyahoga County Justice Center in Cleveland, laid bare the prodigious power that judges hold and the many ways they can wield that power to try to get what they want.If you’re harmed by the police, what does it take to find justice in court that actually feels like justice?One way is by suing the police — as the civil rights lawyer Paul Cristallo did for his client Erimius Spencer.Spencer’s encounter with the police in the city of Euclid, Ohio, on the east side of Cleveland, over a minor drug offense, landed him in the hospital with a broken orbital bone that swelled his face and led doctors to transfer him to a bigger hospital to make sure his eye would be OK.In October 2015, an awful crime gripped Cleveland: the shooting death of a 5-month-old named Aavielle Wakefield. She’d been riding in a car with her family when someone started shooting from the street.Two months later, officials in the Ohio city held a news conference to announce the arrest of a 19-year-old man. But just a year after that, he walked free — he was the wrong guy. Everyone wants to solve the killing of Aavielle. So what happened?Of all the people who shape a criminal case, prosecutors have the most discretion, especially, and crucially, at the beginning. Following one prosecutor in the major trial unit of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office offers a window into how such attorneys exercise that discretion.How do they make decisions? To what extent are such decisions guided by individual prosecutors’ own sense of what is right? And how much is beyond their control?In the summer of 2016, Jesse Nickerson was arrested by two East Cleveland police officers who, he said, handcuffed and beat him in a park. The officers said he had hurt himself. One officer eventually pleaded guilty to a couple of misdemeanors in the case, the other to a couple of felonies.For Nickerson, the story — and his conflict with the police in Ohio — did not end there.In this episode, Sarah and the producer, Emmanuel Dzotsi, return to the stories of Spencer and Nickerson.The men’s experiences reveal how even relatively positive outcomes in court do not erase the toll of violent encounters with the police.In this episode, the focus turns to the juvenile justice system, whose mission is different from that of the adult system.The point isn’t to punish, it’s to rehabilitate. In the juvenile system, the authorities are expected to think like parents, and the standard of treatment should be the same as it is for one’s own child.The experience of a 19-year-old named Joshua puts those ideals to the test.Joshua makes the transition from the Indian River Juvenile Correctional Facility to the county jail and eventually to prison.And reflecting on a year spent embedded in the Cuyahoga County criminal justice system, Sarah offers suggestions for change.When it launched in 2014, “Serial” became a global sensation that has been credited with launching the modern era of audio journalism. The New York Times Company acquired Serial Productions in 2020.Hosting and executive production by Sarah Koenig; executive production by Julie Snyder; reporting and production by Emmanuel Dzotsi; production by Ben Calhoun; research and fact-checking by Ben Phelan; digital editing by Whitney Dangerfield; social media editing by Julie Whitaker; operations direction by Seth Lind; editing by Emily Condon; sound design and mixing by Stowe Nelson; and scoring by Adam Dorn and Hal Willner.</body>

	<title>Mets Clinch Playoff Spot With Scherzer’s 200th Win</title>
	<author>Benjamin Hoffman</author>
	<body>The frustration could have been palpable. Max Scherzer, in his first start for the Mets since Sept. 3, was perfect through six innings on the road in Milwaukee, but his day was already done.With the Mets hoping for a deep October run, Manager Buck Showalter pulled Scherzer from his bid at ending baseball’s decade-long streak without a perfect game. And Showalter did it despite Scherzer’s having thrown only 68 pitches.It was the type of sensible but excruciating decision that tends to rile up fans. And the bid at baseball’s first combined perfect game unraveled immediately, as the reliever Tylor Megill allowed a leadoff double to Christian Yelich in the seventh and a two-run homer to Rowdy Tellez two batters later.But after the dust settled, the Mets walked away with a 7-2 victory. That win meant they had clinched their first postseason berth since 2016, and allowed Scherzer, in his return from the injured list, to become the 120th pitcher to reach 200 wins for his career.“This is what you play the game for — you play the game to go to the postseason,” Scherzer told reporters after the game. “We have a lot of things in front of us and we understand that. But, man, you’ve got to celebrate the good times, too.”With the Mets securing at least a wild-card spot in the playoffs, Scherzer’s personal milestone seemed like an afterthought. Plenty of pitchers had reached the 200-win mark before him, and many of them weren’t particularly notable. But with modern bullpen usage making wins for starters far harder to come by, Scherzer and two of his peers who are nearing the mark — Adam Wainwright of the St. Louis Cardinals and Clayton Kershaw of the Los Angeles Dodgers — could be the last pitchers to get to 200 for quite some time.Currently, Scherzer’s 200 wins put him third on the active list behind Justin Verlander of the Houston Astros (243) and Zack Greinke of the Kansas City Royals (223). Wainwright is fourth at 195, just ahead of Kershaw at 193.There is a fairly steep drop-off after that group. David Price of the Dodgers is at 157, but at 37 he is now an often-injured reliever and is unlikely to add many more victories to his résumé. Johnny Cueto of the Chicago White Sox is 36 and has 142 wins, most likely putting him out of reach. Madison Bumgarner of the Arizona Diamondbacks is only 33, and has 133 wins, but he has not managed more than nine wins in a season since 2016.That leaves the next most likely candidate after Wainwright and Kershaw to be Gerrit Cole of the Yankees, who is 32, plays for a team that scores a lot of runs, and already has 129 wins. But even Cole will likely need four or five more seasons to get there. After Cole, it gets far murkier as to who might reach the milestone.Wins being harder to accumulate makes sense. In an analytics-driven era when strikeouts are king, getting through the required five innings to even qualify for a win can be difficult without running up a pitch count.And managers do not take chances once that pitch count starts to rise. Only three pitchers this season have been allowed to throw as many as 120 pitches in a single game after only five got to that number last season. For reference, in 1988, the first year in which Baseball Reference has accurate pitch counts, there were 598 games in which a starting pitcher threw 120 or more pitches despite there being four fewer teams in Major League Baseball at the time.The cruel thing with Scherzer, though, and with Kershaw before him in a similar start back in April, is that both of them had been remarkably efficient and seemingly had a chance of finishing off their perfect game bids without running up their pitch counts. But the bids happened to come in starts where the veteran pitchers were coming back from injuries, which made their managers even more conservative than they might have been otherwise.Even when the situation is not as cut-and-dried, pushing a starter in hopes of getting him an individual accomplishment has largely become a thing of the past. It is sound reasoning even if it can be difficult to stomach in the moment. And it is the same logic that has made the 200-win club, once a mark for a fairly good but not great starter to strive for, suddenly exclusive.But for the Mets, any frustration felt for Scherzer seemed to have melted away thanks to the team having guaranteed a trip to the postseason. And with baseball’s new postseason format allowing the top two seeds in each league to skip the wild-card round, there is still plenty to play for this season despite their postseason ticket having been punched.“We understand this is not the end goal, but it’s part of our destiny,” said shortstop Francisco Lindor.</body>

	<title>At a Moment in London Like No Other, Fashion Forges Ahead</title>
	<author>Elizabeth Paton</author>
	<body>LONDON — On Sunday night — the eve of the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II — the queue of people waiting to pay their last respects to the late monarch stretched so far through the heart of the British capital that it could be seen from space.Across town, at 8 p.m. and as a planned minute of silence hushed the nation, another line of people waited to get into a fashion show. Some things never change.But this season was a London Fashion Week like no other. Britain’s longest reigning monarch died on Sept. 8, plunging the nation into 10 days of official mourning. As the fashion shows were scheduled to begin Sept. 15 and prominent brands like Burberry chose to slip off the calendar, some wondered if fashion week would — or should — happen at all.Beyond its fondness for forming an orderly queue, Britain is also a country with a national identity forged in times of heartache and trouble — of which there recently has been plenty for designers: the continuing fallout from Brexit and the pandemic, and the likelihood of recession.After rallying cries from many designers, including Harris Reed, the shows did go on.“It has been a challenging two years,” the designer, who uses they/them pronouns, said before their first runway show, a typically theatrical gender-fluid twirl of vast crinolines and cartwheel headpieces inspired by debutante balls. “Speaking with my fellow young designers, most of whom have put their entire brand budgets into shows to bring in sales and brand awareness, it is so important, now more than ever, to support the small brands in London.”The season’s parties may have all been canceled, as a gesture of respect. But Harris Reed was the first of several jubilant and determined turns from London’s latest crop of young up-and-coming labels.The edgy Y2K hyper-vixens on the runway from KNWLS, whose mesh prints, pleated miniskirts and uber-low rise flares have spawned a host of fast fashion imitators. A punchy debut from Chopova Lowena, whose dramatic pleated skirts with punky carabiner clips are now sported by the coolest of industry insiders. And a special mention to the Brazilian designer Karoline Vitto who showed with the talent incubator Fashion East. Ms. Vitto’s barely-there creations centered on molded metal frames that highlighted fleshy folds and creases; her use of exclusively curvy models drove home her mission to celebrate aspects of a woman’s body so often hidden from sight.Speaking of flesh flashing, Nensi Dojaka’s signature sheer splicing and intricate cutout creations provided another reminder of why she won the 2021 LVMH Prize for young designers. And this year’s winner, Steven Stokey Daley, enchanted the audience at his S.S. Daley show with an elegantly tailored fable inspired by the love affair between the early 20th-century writers Violet Trefusis and Vita Sackville-West, with hints of the latter’s famous English country garden at Sissinghurst Castle in Kent. “Rabbit” was a code word for their romance. Floppy bunny ears and whiskers popped up among chic knitted sleeveless vests, wide-legged trousers and botanical prints.London has long had a reputation for young fashion talent, but the designer old guard also was on hand with more reminders of why the capital’s fashion reputation also rests on the rich depth of its storytelling.Michael Halpern, with draped leopard print velour and cascading sequins at his Halpern show, offered a tribute to the personal style of his mother, Cheryl. In her show notes, Molly Goddard wrote that she wanted to capture the joyful mood of “people out to have fun,” her hallmark color-popping cascading ruffles tempered into wearable T-shirt dresses and puffball skirts. And inspired by the conversations about women’s bodily autonomy that have followed the U.S. Supreme Court decision to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion, Christopher Kane delved into the female anatomy, from rib-like slivers of clear PVC strips that held together cutaway skirts and bralets to the more literal medical illustrations of muscles and veins that embellished silk column gowns.It was Erdem, whose collection explored the preservation of the past, specifically by those in art conservation, who came closest to matching the mood of the nation. The sweeping double-breasted trench ball gowns, shredded silk coats and full-skirted dresses with intricate floral embroidery — some shrouded in dust sheet-esque white veils — felt elegiac, especially shown amid the colonnades of the British Museum, just as the sun was beginning to set.Yet what can one do, but keep moving forward? With her first foray into men’s wear, Simone Rocha embodied that spirit in the frescoed halls of the Old Bailey, the central criminal court of England and Wales. Oversize bubble bombers, layers of sequined tulle and delicate petticoats and corsetry grounded with parachute straps — for both sexes — clearly reflected Ms. Rocha’s flair for the romantic and the practical while also breaking new ground.And at JW Anderson, the designer’s focus was firmly on the now. More specifically, as the designer said after the show, the parallel transient realities we access when we “fall into our screens and become our phones.” Guests fought their way through the heaving streets of Soho on Saturday night to reach a cavernous gambling arcade where, against the neon glow of slot machines, Mr. Anderson offered up garments that evoked a wacky universe entered through the portal of digital devices.There were rompers and halterneck mini dresses emblazoned with screen saver stock prints of dolphins, palm trees and goldfish (at one point the model Emily Ratajkowski came gliding past in a black tee with synthetic rubber fins jutting from her back); shift dresses studded with plastic computer keys; oversize sweaters that hung upside down on metal hangers across shoulders; and orb-like dresses of pixelated glitter or mirrors reflecting the world around us.Asked afterward about the optics of fashion shows continuing during a period of national mourning, the Northern Irish designer — whose final look, a black T-shirt with the words “Her Majesty The Queen 1926-2022 Thank you” on the front, used lettering like the homage posters that had appeared on bus stop shelters around the city — was firm about how London should face its new reality.“It felt important to keep going, because this is a time when London needs to stick together, and right now some of this city’s young designers are at risk of losing their businesses,” he said to reporters backstage, as revelers outside drank the night away. “That is an extremely British attitude.”</body>

	<title>La mayoría de los votantes latinos están fuera del alcance del Partido Republicano, según una nueva encuesta</title>
	<author>Ruth Igielnik</author>
	<body>Han pasado casi dos años desde que Donald Trump logró algunos avances sorpresivos con los electores latinos. Pero según un nuevo sondeo de The New York Times y Siena College, no se han logrado materializar los sueños de los republicanos sobre una importante reorientación de los votantes latinos hacia las posturas de su partido sobre los problemas sociales y la delincuencia.Este sondeo —una de las encuestas no partidistas más grandes relacionadas con los electores latinos desde las elecciones de 2020— reveló que los demócratas habían mantenido un control sobre la mayoría de los electores latinos, motivados en parte por mujeres y por la creencia de que los demócratas seguían siendo el partido de la clase trabajadora. En general, es más probable que los votantes latinos estén de acuerdo con los demócratas en muchos temas: inmigración, política sobre el control de armas, cambio climático. También es más probable que vean a los republicanos como el partido de la élite y como el movimiento que tiene posturas extremas. Además, una mayoría de los electores latinos, el 56 por ciento, piensa votar por los demócratas este otoño, en comparación con el 32 por ciento que pretende votar por los republicanos.Pero en la consulta también se ven señales preocupantes para el futuro del mensaje de los demócratas. Pese a esa cómoda ventaja, el sondeo revela que los demócratas están mucho peor que en los años anteriores a las elecciones de 2020. Parece que los electores latinos más jóvenes, sobre todo los del sur, se están alejando del partido, un cambio que es impulsado por las enormes inquietudes en materia económica. En las elecciones intermedias de este año, deficiencias en el sur y entre los electores de las zonas rurales se podrían interponer en los triunfos importantísimos de Texas y Florida.Anthony Saiz, de 24 años, quien reseña el contenido de una plataforma de redes sociales en Tucson, Arizona, comentó que, para salir adelante, tuvo que aceptar un segundo empleo como pizzero en una cervecería. Saiz votó por Joe Biden en 2020 y se considera demócrata porque creció dentro de una familia demócrata. Pero cree que durante el mandato de Biden el costo de la vida se duplicó, pese a que se mudó a un apartamento más pequeño.“Las decisiones que ha tomado para el país me han puesto en una situación muy difícil”, comentó acerca del presidente.La manera en que voten los latinos será un asunto fundamental en las elecciones de noviembre y para el futuro de la política estadounidense. La participación de los electores latinos es decisiva en la lucha por el control del Congreso y conforman una parte considerable de los votantes —hasta el 20 por ciento— en dos de los estados que más probabilidades tienen de decidir el control del Senado: Arizona y Nevada. Los latinos también representan más del 20 por ciento de los electores registrados en más de una decena de contiendas muy competitivas para la Cámara de Representantes en California, Colorado, Florida y Texas, entre otros estados.Desde hace mucho tiempo, los demócratas han pensado que el creciente electorado latino condenaría a los republicanos, y las posibilidades de que haya un electorado cada vez más diverso han avivado las preocupaciones de los conservadores. Los resultados de las elecciones de 2020 —en las cuales, en comparación con 2016, Trump ganó más o menos unos ocho puntos porcentuales entre los votantes latinos— comenzaron a cambiar el panorama de ambos partidos. La encuesta del Times/Siena revela que siguen arraigadas las creencias y las lealtades históricas con respecto a los temas centrales, aunque hay algunos cambios que llaman mucho la atención.Aunque las mayorías de los votantes hispanos apoyan a los demócratas en temas sociales y culturales, una parte muy considerable sigue teniendo creencias que se alinean con los republicanos: más de una tercera parte de los electores hispanos afirman que están más de acuerdo con el Partido Republicano en los temas relacionados con la delincuencia y la vigilancia policial, y a cuatro de cada diez votantes hispanos les preocupa que el Partido Demócrata haya ido demasiado lejos en materia de raza y género. Los votantes latinos consideran que los problemas económicos son el factor más importante que determinará su voto este año y están divididos de manera uniforme acerca de con qué partido están más de acuerdo en lo que se refiere a la economía.Los electores latinos en Estados Unidos nunca han sido un bloque de votación monolítico y con frecuencia desconciertan a los estrategas políticos que tratan de entender su comportamiento. Los 32 millones de latinos que pueden votar son inmigrantes recientes y ciudadanos de cuarta generación, habitantes de las ciudades y de las zonas rurales, católicos y ateos.Ambos partidos se han llenado de fanfarronerías y han disparado sus expectativas respecto a los votantes latinos, recaudando y gastando millones de dólares para atraer su apoyo, pero hay pocos datos concretos no partidistas que respalden sus especulaciones. La encuesta ofrece una visión de una parte del electorado que muchos estrategas han denominado como el nuevo voto indeciso y cuyas opiniones suelen ser complicadas por las contradicciones entre subgrupos.Dani Bernal, de 35 años, que se dedica al mercadeo digital y es empresaria en Los Ángeles, dijo que alterna entre los candidatos de ambos partidos, en gran parte basándose en sus políticas económicas. Dijo que su madre llegó a Florida desde Bolivia con solo una bolsa de ropa y 500 dólares, y pudo prosperar porque los impuestos eran bajos y el costo de la vida era asequible. Bernal dijo que los temas económicos tienen una gran importancia en sus decisiones.“Estoy registrada como republicana, pero soy exactamente igual que Florida: voy de un lado a otro”, dijo.Los republicanos están teniendo un mejor desempeño con los votantes latinos que viven en el sur, una zona que incluye estados como Florida y Texas, donde los republicanos han logrado victorias importantes en las elecciones recientes con los votantes latinos. En el sur, 46 por ciento de los electores latinos dicen que piensan votar por los demócratas, mientras que el 45 por ciento afirman que planean votar por los republicanos. Por el contrario, en otras zonas del país, los demócratas tienen del 62 al 24 por ciento entre los electores latinos.Es posible que una brecha generacional también lleve a los republicanos a obtener más triunfos. La encuesta reveló que los demócratas gozaban de un gran respaldo sobre todo entre los electores latinos de mayor edad, pero el 46 por ciento de los votantes menores de 30 años apoyan el manejo de la economía por parte de los republicanos, en comparación con el 43 por ciento que están a favor de los demócratas.Los republicanos también tienen fuerza entre los varones latinos, quienes apoyan más a los demócratas en las elecciones intermedias, pero, por un margen de cinco puntos, dicen que votarían por Trump si volviera a contender en 2024. Parece que los varones jóvenes, sobre todo, están dando un giro hacia los republicanos. Son un importante punto débil para los demócratas quienes, con los varones menores de 45 años, mantienen una ventaja de solo cuatro puntos en las elecciones intermedias.La encuesta del Times/Siena ofrece una visión de los votantes latinos que tradicionalmente han apoyado a los demócratas en el pasado pero que planean votar a los republicanos este otoño: son desproporcionadamente votantes sin título universitario que se centran en la economía, y es más probable que sean jóvenes, hombres y nacidos en Estados Unidos, pero que viven en zonas con gran presencia de hispanos.La inmigración sigue siendo un tema primordial para los electores latinos, y ambos partidos tienen un atractivo particular. Mientras que los demócratas han presionado para reformar el sistema de inmigración legal y ofrecen una vía para que muchos inmigrantes que viven de manera ilegal en el país obtengan la ciudadanía, los republicanos se han enfocado en tomar medidas enérgicas contra la inmigración ilegal y en usar la política fronteriza para impulsar sus bases.Los demócratas conservan una gran ventaja en el tema de la inmigración legal y el 55 por ciento de los electores latinos afirman estar de acuerdo con este partido, en comparación con el 29 por ciento que dicen estar de acuerdo con los republicanos. Pero el Partido Republicano ha avanzado cuando ha acentuado la retórica y la política antiinmigración: 37 por ciento de los electores latinos apoyan las posturas de los republicanos con respecto a la inmigración ilegal. Y aproximadamente una tercera parte de estos respalda la construcción de un muro en la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos.Amelia Alonso Tarancón, de 69 años, quien emigró de Cuba hace 14 años y ahora vive en las afueras de Fort Lauderdale, Florida, quiere que el Congreso le proporcione estatus legal a los trabajadores que viven en el país de manera ilegal y que han estado ahí durante décadas. Pero concuerda con los republicanos en sus posturas radicales contra la inmigración ilegal. Esta idea la motivó a votar por Trump, pese a que es una demócrata registrada.“Sé que este país es un país de inmigrantes, pero deben migrar de forma legal”, dijo. Pero Alonso Tarancón dijo que ya no apoyaba al expresidente después de que se negó a entregar la presidencia, impulsó el ataque al Capitolio de Estados Unidos y “se llevó todos esos documentos” a Mar-a-Lago.“No me considero ni demócrata ni republicana, ahora mismo estoy en espera hasta las próximas elecciones”, dijo.En su esfuerzo por atraer nuevos votantes, los republicanos han criticado con frecuencia a los demócratas por ser demasiado “concienciados” o woke. Esa acusación resuena entre muchos votantes hispanos porque el 40 por ciento dice que el partido ha ido demasiado lejos al impulsar una ideología “concienciada” en materia de raza y género. Pero hay una clara división: el 37 por ciento opina lo contrario y dice que el partido no ha ido lo suficientemente lejos. Y casi uno de cada cinco votantes hispanos encuestados dijo que no sabía si los demócratas eran demasiado woke, un término que no se puede traducir fácilmente al español.En lo que se refiere a muchos temas sociales y culturales, los electores latinos siguen estando alineados con el Partido Republicano.La mayoría, un 58 por ciento, tiene una buena opinión del movimiento “Las vidas negras importan”, mientras que el 45 por ciento también apoyan el movimiento “Las vidas azules importan”, el cual defiende al personal de la policía. Una mayoría cree que el aborto debe ser legal en casi todos los casos; incluso entre los latinos republicanos, cuatro de cada diez personas rechazan la decisión de la Corte Suprema de anular la sentencia del caso Roe contra Wade. El apoyo a “Las vidas negras importan” y al derecho al aborto es impulsado principalmente por los jóvenes. Al preguntarles con quién están más de acuerdo en el caso de la política sobre el control de armas, el 49 por ciento dijo que con los demócratas, mientras que el 34 por ciento afirmó que con los republicanos.En repetidas ocasiones, los republicanos que intentan ganarse a los electores latinos han descrito a los demócratas como elitistas y alejados de la realidad, pero la encuesta indica que esta estrategia está teniendo un éxito limitado.Casi seis de cada 10 votantes latinos siguen viendo al Partido Demócrata como el partido de la clase trabajadora. Aunque los republicanos blancos se consideran de modo uniforme como el partido de la clase trabajadora, incluso algunos republicanos latinos creen que esa es una característica de los demócratas. Además, en la encuesta no se obtuvieron pruebas de que los republicanos estuvieran teniendo un mejor desempeño entre la población latina sin estudios universitarios ni entre los latinos de las zonas rurales, dos grupos demográficos fundamentales a los que han querido acercarse. Uno de cada cuatro votantes latinos de las zonas rurales sigue sin decidir por quién votar en noviembre.Los demócratas han sido criticados con contundencia por su aceptación del término Latinx, que tiene el propósito de ser más inclusivo que las palabras “latino” y “latina”, las cuales marcan el género. Encuestas anteriores han revelado que solo una pequeña minoría de votantes latinos prefieren ese término. Pero la encuesta indicaba que Latinx no es, en absoluto, el tema más polarizador; solo el 18 por ciento señaló que ese término le parecía ofensivo.La encuesta del Times/Siena, realizada a 1399 votantes registrados en todo el país, incluida una sobremuestra de 522 votantes hispanos, se llevó a cabo por teléfono con operadores en directo del 6 al 14 de septiembre de 2022. El margen de error de muestreo es de más o menos 3,6 puntos porcentuales para la muestra completa y de 5,9 puntos porcentuales entre los votantes hispanos. Las tabulaciones cruzadas y la metodología están disponibles para todos los votantes registrados y para los votantes hispanos.Nate Cohn colaboró en este reportaje.Jennifer Medina es una reportera de política nacional y cubre las actitudes políticas y el poder con énfasis en el oeste estadounidense.

	<title>In His Vancouver Home, a Lighting Designer Embraces a Natural Glow</title>
	<author>Nick Marino</author>
	<body>OMER ARBEL USED to live on the cliff’s edge. He had a windswept shack perched on a promontory overlooking the industrial port of Vancouver, British Columbia, the sort of experimental space — “no handrails,” he says, “and sharp things everywhere” — befitting an avant-garde architect and lighting designer. Then in 2015 he met a ballerina, Rachel Meyer, and after having a child together two years later, they decided to find a more conventional home, one fully at odds with his personal aesthetic.In his own practice — he builds bespoke residences and objects for private clients and since 2005 has served as the artistic director of Bocci, a British Columbian lighting and glassblowing studio he co-founded — Arbel aims to “activate these traditional, cozy spaces with some extreme things,” he says. The designer is seated at a round wooden table in his low-ceilinged kitchen on a damp Vancouver afternoon beneath a primordial aluminum light fixture he calls 44 (all of Bocci’s pieces are chronologically numbered), which was first exhibited in 2016 at the Barbican Centre in London and looms over him like a floating coral reef. “There’s a tension between these aggressive interventions and this unassuming interior.”Arbel, 46, was born in Jerusalem and raised in a severe Bauhaus-style house. His father practiced law; his mother taught religious studies with a focus on ancient mysticism. He has lived in and around Vancouver since 1989. Comparing the area to San Francisco, he said that he had watched with dismay as “neighborhoods that used to have a community feeling have been — some over the course of five years — completely gutted by the forces of gentrification,” adding, “So many of the houses are seen only as real estate assets; they’re not actually lived in.” If he and Meyer, 35, were going to buy in town at all, they wanted to do so in East Vancouver, a neighborhood historically shared by immigrants and graffiti artists, near the office he bikes to whenever it’s not raining.THE HOME THEY chose was the first they saw — a sage green Craftsman bungalow built in 1910 with a magnolia tree then in pink bloom beyond the front porch. The place needed lots of work: The foundation had crumbled; the basement had standing water. Although they spent two years restoring the entire structure, they kept the original layout, a counterintuitive choice that reveals itself immediately upon crossing the threshold. Everywhere, there are doors made from Douglas fir that the couple often keep closed, creating intimate vignettes from room to room that rebuke the contemporary preference for open-plan environments. “There’s a temptation to bust down walls and connect the dining room and kitchen,” Arbel says. “But instead, we thought, ‘Let’s try to respect the original architect’s vision and see how we do.’” This, in turn, allows them to live as previous residents might have: Once or twice a week, the family cooks a special meal in the compact kitchen and serves it in the adjacent formal dining room.To avoid feeling closed in, they streamlined the small rooms wherever they could. Arbel loathes unsightly light switch plates, so the kitchen doesn’t have any. He also despises drawer pulls and handles and pointed to the smooth cabinetry, noting his preference for “as few protrusions as possible.” Even the toilet is missing a handle. His bathroom is covered in hexagonal tiles from Heath Ceramics, all of which are forest green; you press a sole white aluminum panel to flush.The rest of the home’s walls are of matte white-painted burlap, and the couple has placed sculptural furnishings throughout to keep the place from feeling too austere. In the foyer, there’s a florid oak Calvet bench designed in 1902 by the Surrealist Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí; instead of a coffee table, they installed a rock formation of polished marble boulders in streaky shades of Creamsicle, pistachio, black and jade. Suspended from the ceiling is a pearlescent 2017 Bocci light fixture, 87, that stretches out like saltwater taffy. These whimsical touches are packed into a ground-floor living space that’s 1,250 square feet; a 500-square-foot attic that the couple call their love nest, a refuge away from their 5-year-old daughter; and a 1,300-square-foot basement that contains Meyer’s ballet barre and a guest suite.Outside, on the property’s modest plot, they’ve planted a vegetable patch near a salvaged industrial culvert that serves as a makeshift kiddie pool. There’s also a homemade treehouse in the backyard, complete with its own skylight — in this family, even a child’s play area must be nicely lit. The adjacent garden includes sculpture 16, from 2015, essentially a bead-blasted steel tree that sends low-voltage electricity through a network of branches and twinkling glass leaves.None of this illumination — even the natural light, this being the Pacific Northwest — is particularly bright, allowing the project’s disparate elements to play off each other. To Arbel, a true sense of coziness ultimately comes from “many sources admitting light horizontally, ideally and not too much,” creating a sense of mystery, of life that can be lived in the glow of perpetual dusk.</body>

	<title>Billions in Climate Deal Funding Could Help Protect U.S. Coastal Cities</title>
	<author>Stephanie Lai</author>
	<body>NEWPORT BAY, Calif. — Claire Arre, a marine biologist, waded through the sand in search of an Olympia oyster on a recent sunny afternoon, monitoring the bed her organization had built to clean up the surrounding watershed and contemplating all that could be done if she could get her hands on federal funding to expand the work.Ms. Arre’s project aims to combat climate change using nature instead of human-engineered construction, and it is one of many across the nation’s 254 coastal counties that is eligible for billions in federal funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the sprawling climate, health care and tax bill signed last month by President Biden.The measure could “have a direct result in getting our next restoration project off the ground and sharing the beneficial impacts here into another area,” said Ms. Arre, the director of marine restoration for Orange County Coastkeeper, a nonprofit group, as she meticulously scanned the site, surrounded by sandbars and cliffs, pickleweed and docked boats.The group hopes to expand to nearby Huntington Harbour, and it has been seeking funding to do so.A little-noticed section of Democrats’ climate legislation, which made the largest federal investment in history to combat the warming of the planet, injects $2.6 billion over five years into coastal communities across the country through grants to fund projects that prepare and respond to hazardous climate-related events and disturbances. The program makes up less than 1 percent of the total climate investment in the law, but it is widely regarded as a significant step and the latest sign of a shift by the federal government toward funding nature-based climate solutions.Officials from coast to coast have long sought funding to restore natural habitats that are essential to beach communities, as floods wreak havoc in the East and rising sea levels increasingly threaten the West. By 2050, sea levels are expected to rise by a foot or more on average, increasing as much in that time as they have in the past century.Scientists expect the impact of climate change to be far more damaging in the future. Rising sea levels have been exacerbated by flooding and cataclysmic rainstorms, called “megastorms,” that could upend San Francisco and cities across the globe. Along the East Coast, sea-level rise and flooding from rainfall have been threatening cities in Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and Florida, among others. Cities are facing a number of obstacles like repairing destroyed roads and drains or retreating inland. And paying for such measures presents yet another challenge.“Our coastal areas are shrinking before our very eyes, and people are being displaced,” said Representative Troy Carter, Democrat of Louisiana, whose home state has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast — roughly the size of Delaware — since the 1930s. The coastal restoration funding “is a grand-slam home run,” he said.Escalating climate threats have prompted a continuing debate among policymakers and experts about how best to guard against devastating damage, between those who prioritize building man-made infrastructure like sea walls — sometimes called “gray infrastructure” — and those who favor nature-based solutions, or so-called green infrastructure.Some scientists and climate organizations see the climate law as a clear signal that the government is giving priority to natural solutions.“You are seeing a lot more attention and acceptance of greener options,” said Charles Lester, the director of the Ocean and Coastal Policy Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “It’s a spectrum of ways of responding to shoreline change, and this funding is causing us to think more completely and more holistically about all the different pieces of these puzzles.”Tom Cors, a government relations official at the Nature Conservancy, said the resilience funding in the climate law, in combination with resources in the infrastructure law passed last year, represented the most significant influx of money for green infrastructure, the latest move in a shift that began about a decade ago.A substantive legislation. The $370 billion climate, tax and health care package that President Biden signed on Aug. 16 could have far-reaching effects on the environment and the economy. Here are some of the key provisions:Auto industry. Until now, taxpayers could get up to $7,500 in tax credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, but there was a cap on how many cars from each manufacturer were eligible. The new law will eliminate this cap and extend the tax credit until 2032; used cars will also qualify for a credit of up to $4,000.Energy industry. The legislation will provide billions of dollars in rebates for Americans who buy energy efficient and electric appliances. Companies will get tax credits for building new sources of emissions-free electricity. The package also includes $60 billion set aside to encourage clean energy manufacturing and penalties for methane emissions that exceed federal limits starting in 2024.Health care. For the first time, Medicare will be allowed to negotiate with drugmakers on the price of some prescription medicines. The law also extends subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act, which were set to expire at the end of the year, for an additional three years.Tax code. The law introduces a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax on the profits companies report to shareholders, applying to companies that report more than $1 billion in annual income but are able to use credits, deductions and other tax treatments to lower their effective tax rates. The legislation will bolster the I.R.S. with an investment of about $80 billion.Low-income communities. The package includes over $60 billion in support of low-income communities and communities of color that are disproportionately burdened by climate change. Among the provisions are grants for zero-emissions technology and money to mitigate the negative effects of highways and other transportation facilities.Fossil fuels industry. The legislation requires the federal government to auction off more public space for oil drilling and expand tax credits for coal and gas-burning plants that rely on carbon capture technology. These provisions are among those that were added to gain the support of Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia.West Virginia. The law is expected to bring big benefits to Mr. Manchin’s state, the nation’s second-largest producer of coal, making permanent a federal trust fund to support miners with black lung disease and offering new incentives to build wind and solar farms in areas where coal mines or coal plants have recently closed.The bipartisan infrastructure measure added $3 billion to the federal pot for projects related to habitat restoration and climate resilience, but funding has yet to be disbursed as the application process is still underway, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Nearly half of it is earmarked for “high-impact natural infrastructure projects.”And in 2020, Mr. Biden signed legislation that mandated that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the main civil engineering agency of the government that has historically favored gray infrastructure, consider nature-based solutions during an early planning stage of some projects.The funding from the new climate law will be distributed to NOAA, which is expected to provide funding through contracts, grants and other agreements to local, state and tribal governments, nonprofits and institutions of higher education. The law specified that the money should go to projects that support natural resources in coastal and marine communities, including wetland restoration or restoring sea grass and oyster beds. It also said the funding should be used to protect fisheries and for projects that protect communities from extreme storms and climate change.Some examples include adding sand or restoring dunes to provide a buffer for the receding shoreline. Wetland restoration also helps absorb storm waters and carbon dioxide — a chemical in the atmosphere known for warming the planet — and contribute to biodiversity. The flow of water can also be slowed by restoring sea grass and oyster beds.Amy Hutzel, the executive officer for California’s State Coastal Conservancy, the state’s leading nature-based restoration agency, said she was pleased that the climate law focused on nature-based projects, which can reduce the impact of wind and wave patterns along the coast, as opposed to building levees and sea walls.The moment a city constructs a levee or a sea wall, it “is immediately deteriorating,” Ms. Hutzel said. “When you work with nature, you are building a system that the natural processes are maintaining.”Some scientists argue that such an approach can be more cost-effective than man-made projects. A New York City study in Queens showed that using gray infrastructure would be twice as expensive as incorporating both gray and green projects.But nature-based solutions, while attractive, can be difficult to execute, Mr. Lester noted.Jennifer Brunton, the New York district water business line leader at WSP, an engineering consulting firm, said many of her clients turn away from green infrastructure because they do not have enough space for nature-based solutions and because it is less mainstream.“They’re hallmark projects,” Ms. Brunton said. “Gray infrastructure is tried and true.”Gray infrastructure has traditionally been preferred by homeowners along the coast who are willing to part with their beach access if it means creating concrete fixtures that can safeguard their homes, as well as city officials who are skeptical about the effectiveness of green infrastructure. Proponents of gray infrastructure also argue that green projects need constant maintenance, whereas gray infrastructure can be easier to maintain.In Pacifica, Calif., homeowners like Mark Stechbart, a retiree, have been calling for more gray infrastructure to offset the sea-level rise that is threatening their properties. The coastline in his Northern California community does not have the right conditions for green infrastructure, Mr. Stechbart said, leaving the city with two options: go gray or go inland.“Gray infrastructure, at least around here, is the only thing that works,” Mr. Stechbart said in an interview. “Either we have a town that functions or we don’t.”He added, “There are some areas where if you don’t maintain and improve shoreline protections, a major hotel goes in the water.”Lawmakers in both parties have embraced nature-based infrastructure initiatives, though Republicans opposed the climate law en masse.“Investing in natural infrastructure projects will better protect coastal communities while restoring habitat and stimulating local economic development,” Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, said in a statement.Representative Michelle Steel, Republican of California, has supported nature-based resiliency projects in her district, such as adding sand to Huntington Beach. In a statement explaining why she voted against the Inflation Reduction Act, Ms. Steel said, “We need to cut federal spending and get costs under control instead of expecting American families to foot the bill for Washington’s spending addiction.”Representative Garret Graves, Republican of Louisiana, a champion of resilience projects, also voted no. In a written statement, he said he had little confidence that NOAA would be “fair or transparent” when allocating the funding.</body>

	<title>I Just Got a Big Promotion. Do I Need a Fancier Wardrobe Too? </title>
	<author>Vanessa Friedman</author>
	<body>First of all, congratulations on the new job. The question of how you dress for it, however, is a lot more complicated than just “to suit or not to suit?” It’s really about communication and what values you are trying to model.Fashion, after all, has long functioned as a sign of both aspiration and achievement; a covert signal of wealth, access, taste, smarts and membership in a club. So as people climbed the corporate ladder, they used their clothes to reflect each rung.That’s what gave the world the adage “dress for the job you want.” Also the man in the gray flannel suit.Between the casualization of the workplace, however, and changing attitudes toward the balance of power between the individual and the employer, such dress codes are increasingly downplayed. Not gone entirely, but more … well, coded.So while you don’t necessarily need to dress fancier for your new job, you need to dress with more consideration. With more responsibility comes more attention. More people will be “reading” not just your emails and memos, but also your expressions and, yup, even your shirts.Authenticity is an important quality these days, so doing a complete about-face in your dress to go with your new title is probably not a good idea. Instead, consider the details.Generally, as a boss, you want to show authority, organization, decisiveness, attention to detail and dependability. That doesn’t mean you need a tie or the pussy bow equivalent, but it does mean clothes that are rumpled, ill-fitting, stained or otherwise fraying are not good. At the very least, you may want to enlist a tailor to ensure a perfect fit. (A tailor can also make an inexpensive suit look like a much pricier garment.) Well-made garments also demonstrate that you can identify and recognize quality, which is more important than quantity. Make sure your shoes are in good shape.Consistency and personal signatures are also values worth embracing. There is a reason President Barack Obama said he always wore dark gray or blue suits, and Steve Jobs wore the same Issey Miyake turtleneck every day. And if you invest in a few good pieces and wear them like a uniform, you can amortize the expense over time.Then design your choices to fit the job description.If you are dealing with tight budgets or different fund allocations, sticking with your two-for-$30 polos may work as a show of solidarity; a sign that whatever belt-tightening you are demanding from your staff is belt-tightening you are willing to do yourself.If your job is about creativity, demonstrating creativity with dress makes sense.

	<title>In Istanbul’s Private Retreats of the Sultans, Time Stands Still</title>
	<author>Lisa Morrow</author>
	<body>Inside one of the elegant pavilions known in Istanbul as a kasir, the clamor and chaos of big city life recedes. The noise of car horns and shouting vendors is replaced by near silence. Listen carefully for the imagined whisper of silk rustling in the breeze or the echo of a once vital conversation abruptly curtailed. In these discreet and sophisticated structures and summer palaces, built only for the sultans, time stands still. Ostensibly intended as private retreats away from the formality of the courts at Topkapı and Dolmabahçe palaces, in reality kasir were places to scheme and plot. Each is a snapshot of a particular moment in history and an intimate and enticing slice of Ottoman life.In these exquisite kasir scattered around Istanbul, sultans could fantasize they were absolute masters of the Ottoman universe, shielded from upheaval and attempts to foment political discontent in their courts and territories. Today, these kasir exist as more than just historical monuments made of wood, stone and tile. They reflect the majesty and splendor, mystery and intrigue of a once mighty empire that held the world in thrall for more than 600 years. Here are three.It’s easy to walk straight past Hünkar Kasri in Eminönü on the Haliç (Golden Horn). Austere exterior walls and an unassuming entry give nothing away. The kasir is part of the Yeni Camii (New Mosque) complex Sultan Murat III ordered built at the request of his favorite concubine, Safiye Sultan, in the 16th century. Then as now Eminönü was a commercial center but it was a multicultural neighborhood largely inhabited by non-Muslims. Safiye Sultan wanted to Islamicize the area by building a mosque. The first stones were laid around 1597, but work stopped shortly afterward.It started again in 1661 by order of Valide Turhan Sultan, the mother of Sultan Mehmet IV, who had been brought into the palace as a slave and eventually became the chief consort of one sultan, and mother of the next. As Valide Sultan, she oversaw the completion of the whole complex, which contained not only a mosque, but also a school, public fountains, a market and a tomb. It’s thought to be the first such complex ordered built by a woman. It opened in 1663 and was supposedly designed as a place to rest before or after prayers, or on special religious days.The first room on the right after the entranceway is believed to have been the chamber of the Valide Sultan. Note the masonry windowsills, both worn down on the left hand side. It’s said the women of the court would lean on them and gaze wistfully at the activity outside. Given that Turhan was the only Valide Sultan ever to have the legal right to help run the Ottoman Empire, it sounds like mere fancy. More likely she wore down the frames planning her son’s next political move.Small as it is, the building has an Escher-like quality in the way shapes, such as rectangular door frames repeated along a short hallway, give the effect of a much larger space. All the walls and the eyvan, the domed space off the central hall, are covered in rare and exquisite Iznik tiles from the 17th century, specially created for this building. It’s worthwhile just standing quietly for some time in each of the rooms because there’s more color and movement in the tile work than can be absorbed in a casual glance.Hünkar Kasri is now used as an art gallery, open Tuesday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. year round. Entry is free.Nestled in a valley a short taxi ride inland from Beşiktaş wharf on the European shores of the Bosporus, İhlamur Kasri was built on land originally used as a haşbahçe, an imperial garden. It was part of a hunting ground established by Sultan Ahmed III in the 17th century and stretched as far as Yıldız Palace farther up the strait. Even now, moss-covered stones carved with the archery records of various sultans lie half-hidden in the grounds.One of these was Sultan Abdülmecid I. Between 1848 and 1855 he had Nigoğos Balyan, the architect who designed the Dolmabahçe Palace with his father, Garabet Amira Balyan, build the Meraşım Köşkü (Ceremonial Pavilion) and Harem Köşkü (also called the Maiyet Köşkü, or Retinue Pavilion) that together form İhlamur Kasrı. The buildings and the gardens were laid out according to Islamic principles, the most important being the placement of the pavilions in spots providing the best view of their surroundings. At the same time, these structures had to appear to blend in with the gardens, as if they were part of nature. To achieve this they were melded into the terrain utilizing terraces, embankments and watercourses that are still maintained today.Although İhlamur Kasri was mainly intended as a place for the sultan and his family to relax, the small but grand Meraşım Köşkü was used to entertain influential diplomatic guests. Tours take place with a minimum of three people. There’s no explanatory text on the walls, but the decoration speaks for itself. The front doors open into a small vestibule flanked by two reception rooms. The décor is French in style, with hand-painted ceramic surrounds on the fireplaces, stucco walls embellished to look like marble, and gilt-covered pelmets hung with heavy brocade curtains. All the rooms are filled with original furniture, but unlike the mirror-image designs of the rooms in Dolmabahçe Palace, one room has a barrel ceiling ornamented with gilded moldings while the other has delicately painted floral designs dancing overhead.Before leaving, have a glass of tea at the Harem Köşkü, the other pavilion in the grounds. It’s home to a Beltur café, owned and operated by the Istanbul Municipality Council. Open 9 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., it serves a variety of hot beverages and snacks. Prices range between 10 and 35 Turkish lira (about 55 cents to about $2). In this calm oasis, despite being surrounded by high rise buildings, it’s easy to imagine the sultan’s children running through the trees in pursuit of game.İhlamur is open to visitors every day except Monday. Entry to the pavilion is 40 Turkish lira, which includes the garden; the garden only is 10 Turkish lira.By the end of the 19th century, the might of the Ottoman Empire was on the wane, yet foreign dynasties still looked toward Turkey when they needed a powerful ally. Hidiv Kasri, in Beykoz on the Asian side of Istanbul, was built by the Egyptians with this in mind.When Abbas Hilmi II became the Egyptian khedive, or viceroy, in 1892, he decided to work with rather than against the Ottomans. He hoped to undermine the British, who had occupied Egypt and Sudan since 1882, by fostering a spirit of cooperation with the Turks. His plan was to wine and dine the Ottomans and seduce them to do Egypt’s bidding.He commissioned a famous architect to build Hidiv Kasri as an elegant summer residence in the Art Nouveau style, either one of the Italian architects Delfo Seminati or Raimondo D’Arcono, or possibly even the Slovenian court architect Antonio Lasciac; it’s not clear which one. To complicate things further, the Egyptian Princess Cavidan Hanim, originally the Hungarian Countess May Torok von Szendro, who was Abbas Hilmi II’s unofficial and secret second wife at the time, claims she drew up the layout of the rooms, the final interior design and the plantings of the palace gardens. The building was completed in 1907, and it’s still uncertain exactly whose creative mind was behind the finished work.Whatever the truth, the building is a curious mix of on-trend European design and Arabic architectural characteristics reworked for Ottoman sensibilities. Marble fountains grace internal courtyards and a curved dining room features Art Deco inspired ceiling lights that transport diners into the plot of an Agatha Christie novel. Minimalist in design, the poolside terrace wouldn’t look out of place in a contemporary five star hotel. The building now serves as a restaurant and cafe.Hidiv Kasri, located at the top of a hill, is most easily reached by taxi from Kanlica wharf for around 30 Turkish lira. It’s open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., and serves a menu the sultans would be proud of, sans alcohol. Enjoy a sumptuous Turkish breakfast or dine on hot and cold meat or vegetable meze such as artichokes cooked in olive oil, followed by kuzu lokum, tender slices of lamb cooked to perfection.Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

	<title>Speeding Up Your Daily Walk Could Have Big Benefits</title>
	<author>Rachel Fairbank</author>
	<body>Many of us regularly wear an activity tracker, which counts the number of steps we take in a day. Based on these numbers, it can be hard to make sense of what they might mean for our overall health. Is it just the overall number of steps in a day that matter, or does exercise intensity, such as going for a brisk walk or jog, make a difference?In a new study, which looks at activity tracker data from 78,500 people, walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace. These results were recently published in two papers in the journals JAMA Internal Medicine and JAMA Neurology.For these studies, which included participants from UK Biobank, participants with an average age of 61 agreed to wear activity trackers for seven full days, including nights, at the beginning of the trial. This study represents the largest one to date that incorporates activity tracker data.“Activity tracker data is going to be better than self-reported data,” said Dr. Michael Fredericson, a sports physician at Stanford University, who was not involved in the study. “We know that people’s ability to self-report is flawed,” often because people don’t accurately remember how much exercise they did in a day or week.After collecting this data, researchers then tracked participant’s health outcomes, which included whether they developed heart disease, cancer, dementia or died during a period of six to eight years.Researchers found that every 2,000 additional steps a day lowered the risk of premature death, heart disease and cancer by about 10 percent, up to about 10,000 steps per day. When it came to developing dementia, 9,800 steps per day was associated with a 50 percent reduced risk, with a risk reduction of 25 percent starting at about 3,800 steps per day. Above 10,000 steps a day, there just weren’t enough participants with that level of activity to determine whether there were additional benefits.In the past, similar studies have also shown that the benefits of walking start well before the often-touted 10,000 steps a day. But then the researchers of this study did something new. When they looked at the step rate, per minute, of the highest 30 minutes of activity a day, they found that participants whose average highest pace was a brisk walk (between 80 and 100 steps per minute) had better health outcomes compared with those who walked a similar amount each day but at a slower pace.Brisk walkers had a 35 percent lower risk of dying, a 25 percent lower chance of developing heart disease or cancer and a 30 percent lower risk of developing dementia, compared with those whose average pace was slower.To put these numbers into perspective, a person whose total daily steps include 2,400 to 3,000 that are brisk walking could see a sharp reduction in the risk for developing heart disease, cancer and dementia, even without taking many additional steps beyond the total daily number.“It doesn’t have to be a consecutive 30-minute session,” said Matthew Ahmadi, a research fellow at the University of Sydney and one of the authors of the studies. “It can just be in brief bursts here and there throughout your day.”But the important thing is to aim for walking a little faster than your normal pace. When it comes to the differences between brisk walking and jogging, there wasn’t enough data to determine if one was better than another, and both resulted in better overall health outcomes than did a slower average pace. Still, a 2013 study followed 49,005 runners and walkers and suggested that brisk walking or jogging similar distances offer similar heart health benefits, though walking a mile takes longer.This study is part of ongoing research into just how important exercise intensity is to various health outcomes. These latest findings suggest that maintaining good health doesn’t necessarily require a lot of high-intensity exercise and that a regular amount of moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking, can offer a high level of protection against developing conditions such as heart disease, cancer or dementia.When it comes to incorporating more intense exercise into your daily life, Dr. Tamanna Singh, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, often reminds her patients that everything is relative. “Everybody is starting from a different training status,” she said.A brisk pace for one person may not be brisk for another, but what matters is the relative effort. At a light exercise intensity, a person can sing a song, while at a moderate intensity, a person can easily carry a conversation but would struggle to sing. At higher intensities, conversation becomes difficult, if not impossible.When it comes to brisk walking, “at these moderate levels of effort, you are able to increase your aerobic capacity,” Dr. Singh said. In addition to the long-term health benefits, such intensity would also lower blood pressure, moderate blood sugar levels and lower the risk for heart attacks and strokes.The key is to walk at an intensity that is manageable but also slightly pushes the boundaries of what is a comfortable pace.“That constant slow stress on your body is what leads to fitness gains,” Dr. Singh said. “If you’re just getting started, this is probably the easiest way to get started and stay committed, consistent and injury-free.”Rachel Fairbank is a freelance science writer based in Texas.</body>

	<title>Adnan Syed, Freed</title>
	<author>David Leonhardt</author>
	<body>Millions of Americans know about the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee because of the podcast “Serial.” Over 12 episodes in 2014, “Serial” documented the killing of Lee, a high school student near Baltimore, and the conviction of her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed.On the podcast, a team of journalists led by Sarah Koenig, the host of “Serial,” documented major problems with the case against Syed: The prosecution’s timeline was implausible; Syed’s defense lawyer failed to pursue important leads; and the cellphone records supposedly tracking Syed’s location were questionable. The resulting attention led courts to take another look at the case, but not to free Syed.Yesterday, however, a judge freed him after he had spent 23 years behind bars. The judge, Melissa Phinn, overturned his conviction after Baltimore prosecutors had said last week that they no longer had confidence in it. “At this time, we will remove the shackles from Mr. Syed,” Phinn declared. Prosecutors have not yet decided whether they will seek a new trial or drop the charges.For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Sarah Koenig, who was in the courtroom yesterday. And I encourage you to listen to a special episode of “Serial,” released this morning, about the huge turn in the case. (Sarah remains the executive producer of Serial Productions, which The New York Times Company bought in 2020.)David: Sarah, you’ve been following this case for almost a decade now, and Adnan Syed has been in jail for more than two decades. What was it like to hear last week that the prosecutors wanted him released?Sarah: I was shocked. I did not see this coming at all. One of the first things I did was call Adnan’s brother and then his mother — they told me they didn’t know either. The prosecutors who filed the motion to release him kept it pretty tight, it seems.But the shocking part was that this was coming from the state’s side. I felt almost disoriented for about a day. Like the city prosecutor’s office suddenly pulled off a rubber mask and underneath was a scowling defense attorney.David: And what was the scene in the court like yesterday?Sarah: Inside the courtroom, it was packed but very orderly and at times somber and emotional. Outside, though, when Adnan walked out onto the sidewalk: mayhem.David: Did you notice similarities between the argument that the prosecutor is making now and the arguments that Syed’s lawyers have made in the past?Sarah: A lot of what the state is saying in this motion probably feels like déjà vu for the defense side. Many of the arguments are the same — unreliable witness statements, unreliable cellphone evidence. A timeline of the crime that doesn’t hold up. But there are a couple of new things, too.The main is the revelation that the state didn’t hand over information about a possible alternate suspect in the crime. That was a bit of a bombshell.David: Who is this alternate suspect?Sarah: There are two of them actually. The state isn’t naming these people right now, but detectives definitely knew who they were at the time. The state is saying these suspects (either one or both) have criminal histories that are relevant to the crime. And that one of them has a family connection to the location where Hae Min Lee’s car was found.But the most damning thing is that a couple of people had told the prosecutor’s office at the time that one of the suspects had a motive to kill Hae, and even had threatened to do so. And that information was never told to the defense. That alone — not handing over important evidence — could be grounds to overturn a murder conviction.David: When I finished listening to the first season of “Serial” years ago, I had two thoughts. One, if I’d been a juror, I would have voted to acquit, because you certainly raised reasonable doubts. Two, I thought there was a good chance Syed had committed the crime. Am I right to think that you and your colleagues were sufficiently torn that you expected different listeners to come away with different conclusions?Sarah: We knew people would come to different conclusions, of course. Barring some smoking-gun evidence, which we didn’t find (and it seems like no one else has either), there was no way for us to say definitively what happened. But what we were pointing out in our story was that the timeline of the case and the evidence in the case had serious problems. Which meant the people who convicted Adnan of murder, they didn’t know what happened either.And so this kid goes to prison for life at 18, based on a story that wasn’t accurate. That’s what we wanted people to think about: Even setting aside the question of Adnan’s guilt or innocence, are we OK with a system that operates like that?David: The latest events in this case are reminiscent of the fallout from “In the Dark,” a podcast whose reporting helped free Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man who’d been jailed for more than 20 years, for murders he evidently did not commit. Wrongful conviction seems to be a major problem in the U.S. What parts of the Syed case do you think are systemic?Sarah: Where to begin! Questionable interrogation tactics and tunnel vision by police; an overtaxed system that fails to properly interrogate evidence; prosecutors withholding evidence from the defense; our country’s tolerance for insanely long prison sentences; juveniles treated as adults when science tells us they aren’t; racism; how grindingly difficult it is to get the system to take another look at your case once you’ve been convicted; prosecutors and cops who don’t police themselves and then double down when they’re accused of doing something wrong. It’s pretty much — you name it, this case has it.And while I’m up here: There is nothing unusual about the presence of these systemic problems in Adnan’s case. Nothing.For more: Here’s a timeline of Syed’s legal journey.A lawyer warned Donald Trump last year that he could face legal liability if he didn’t return documents he had taken from the White House.A Texas sheriff opened a criminal investigation into Florida’s migrant flights to Martha’s Vineyard, saying the migrants had been misled.Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia plans to campaign next month for Kari Lake, the election-denying Arizona governor candidate, Politico reported.Hurricane Fiona has grown stronger, after deluging Puerto Rico with rain.

Some experts say his words are at odds with the reality of a virus still killing hundreds a day.A Russian missile exploded close to a Ukrainian nuclear power plant.

	<title>The guest list for the queen’s funeral will include presidents and an emperor.</title>
	<author>The New York Times</author>
	<body>Buckingham Palace has not disclosed the names of those who will be at the funeral for Queen Elizabeth II on Monday, but leaders from around the world are expected to be among the 2,000 mourners who are gathered at Westminster Abbey in London.Here is a look at some of those who are expected to attend.President Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, are attending, and  a host of prime ministers, including Anthony Albanese of Australia, Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, and Justin Trudeau of Canada have said they would attend. Presidents Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Sergio Mattarella of Italy and Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany have also said they would attend.Many leaders from the Commonwealth, a voluntary collection of 56 member countries born out of the dissolution of the British Empire, are also expected to attend. They include the president of India, Droupadi Murmu, and the new president of Kenya, William Ruto.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s administrative arm, the European Commission, will also make the trip.The imperial house of Japan will be represented by Emperor Naruhito and his wife, Empress Masako.In addition to members of the British royal family, members of the royal families of several European countries — including Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden — have confirmed that they will travel to pay their respects.Buckingham Palace said in a statement that 200 people who were recognized in the queen’s honors list this year would also join the congregation, including those who made “extraordinary contributions” to the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and those who have volunteered in their local communities.Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and the country’s de facto ruler, is no longer slated to attend the funeral.Pope Francis, who sent a message of condolence to King Charles III last week, will not attend the funeral. The Vatican said it would send a senior official as its representative.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will also not be in attendance. The leaders of Belarus and Myanmar were not invited to the funeral, according to Reuters.After the funeral, a senior palace official said, visiting heads of state and government representatives would attend a reception hosted by the foreign secretary.Emma Bubola and Cora Engelbrecht contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Valery Polyakov, Who Took the Longest Journey in Space, Dies at 80</title>
	<author>Alex Traub</author>
	<body>Dr. Valery Polyakov, a physician and astronaut who held the world record for consecutive days spent in outer space, 437, has died. He was 80.Russia’s space agency announced the death without specifying when or where it occurred or the cause.Dr. Polyakov took off for the Russian Mir space station on Jan. 8, 1994, and returned to Earth 437 days, 17 hours and 38 minutes later, on March 22, 1995. He had orbited Earth 7,075 times and traveled nearly 187 million miles, according to the New Mexico Museum of Space History.A specialist in space medicine, he had volunteered for the mission to prove that the human body could survive microgravity long enough to reach Mars, Wired magazine reported in 2010. He worked out while in space and returned looking “big and strong” — “like he could wrestle a bear” — Wired quoted the American astronaut Norman Thagard as saying.Rather than be carried out of his capsule on his return, Dr. Polyakov walked on his own strength, sat down, stole a cigarette from a friend and began sipping brandy, according to “The Story of Manned Space Stations: An Introduction,” by Philip Baker.Dr. Polyakov’s record remains unbeaten. In March, Mark Vande Hei returned to Earth after spending 355 days in space aboard the International Space Station, the Mir’s successor, a record for an American.Valery Ivanovich Korshunov was born on April 27, 1942, in the Russian city of Tula, according to the Museum of Space History. He changed his name after being adopted by his stepfather.No information on his survivors was available.He was inspired to specialize in space medicine by Boris Yegorov, the first physician to fly in space. Dr. Polyakov developed his expertise in the field at the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems in Moscow.In a history of the Mir space station, NASA said Dr. Polyakov had “contributed greatly to the biomedical studies of long-term human spaceflight.”</body>

	<title>Here’s what to expect as world leaders address the United Nations.</title>
	<author>Farnaz Fassihi</author>
	<body>World leaders’ speeches at the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly began Tuesday with a notable change of protocol: The president of the United States will not be speaking on the first day.Because he was in London on Monday attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II along with many other world leaders, President Biden will speak on Wednesday morning.The United States hosts the U.N. headquarters, so the American president traditionally speaks second after Brazil, whose leader has traditionally spoken first since the 1950s.António Guterres, the secretary general of the U.N., opened the session with a speech about a divided world in peril facing enormous challenges, from the threat of multilateralism, to conflict, climate change and food insecurity. Mr. Guterres told reporters last week that he will set out a call to action with concrete steps for tackling and overcoming these challenges.President Emmanuel Macron of France will be another notable speaker on Tuesday afternoon, reiterating the threat to world order and international law because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The war in Ukraine and its many rippling effects will be a major theme of the General Assembly this week. But there are not many world leaders who have access to the presidents of both Russia and Ukraine.One who does, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, pitched himself as a mediator in his address, after saying in an interview that Russia should return all Ukrainian territory it has captured. Mr. Erdogan has emerged as a key figure in mediating between Ukraine and Russia and, together with Mr. Guterres, led the negotiations that resulted in a deal that allowed Ukraine’s grain to be shipped out of ports in the Black Sea.The United States, the European Union and the African Union are jointly hosting a conference on Tuesday to address the global food insecurity crisis and appease the concerns of developing countries who say the West has ignored their problems and focused too much of its attention and aid on Ukraine.Kishida Fumio, the prime minister of Japan, had been expected to speak on Tuesday, but his trip to New York has been delayed because of a typhoon in Japan. He will be leaving Japan on Tuesday to take on the U.N. stage.Some other speakers on Tuesday:Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, who faces a tight election next month, was the first world leader to give remarks. Mr. Bolsonaro, who faces an election in less than two weeks, focused much of his remarks on his own accomplishments.Olaf Scholz, the new chancellor of Germany, which could face an energy crisis this winter because of the standoff with Russia over Ukraine.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines, the son of the former dictator, who was elected president in June.</body>

	<body>This week, as the world’s leaders gather in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, the United States will deliver a message many thought was not possible: We are going to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, and zero them out by 2050.Over the past 20 months as America’s first-ever national climate adviser, I have witnessed a paradigm shift: The private sector no longer sees climate action as a source of job losses, but rather as an opportunity for job creation and economic revitalization.It’s a striking shift after four years of the Trump administration, which threw science out the window and backed out of the Paris climate agreement. In 2020 the future seemed grim. But today, states and companies are running toward a clean energy future. How did what was once considered impossible become not just feasible, but at the core of America’s manufacturing and economic resurgence?In my early days as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, auto dealers were predicting that shifting to cleaner cars meant vehicle costs would skyrocket and sales would drop, while the autoworkers and steelworkers talked about plant closings and layoffs. Even very early on in the Biden administration, when labor was fully engaged and squarely at the table, the old paradigm that cleaner standards meant job loss was hard to break. And unions worried that a big shift to electric vehicles could pose a fundamental threat to their workers.But quickly the conversation shifted to one of long-term capital investments in E.V. technologies, expanding domestic manufacturing, adding more union jobs and building an E.V. market that would reach 50 percent of new U.S. car sales by 2030. Just a short time ago this shift would have been dismissed as a fairy tale. Not anymore.What helped change the conversation were the voices of young leaders as the effects of climate change worsened. Severe wildfires are burning down homes, floods are sweeping through wide areas and extreme heat is threatening lives and livelihoods, especially for low-income communities.Public and private investments in research and development have also fueled the growth of clean technologies, driving down the costs and attracting industry. Since 2010, the cost of solar energy has decreased by 85 percent, wind energy by 59 percent onshore and 71 percent offshore, and lithium-ion batteries by 89 percent. It’s projected that by 2030, over 120,000 wind turbines will provide clean energy to America’s homes, businesses and communities, and nearly a billion solar panels will be operating here.As technologies advanced and companies saw the potential to profit, the private sector looked to the government for clear signals and sound policies. In time, governors of blue and red states, and mayors of cities across the country, started running toward clean energy goals with benchmarks for clean power.When President Biden came into office, he signed executive orders that created timetables and milestones for every sector of the economy and mobilized his entire administration toward this goal. The president sent clear signals to the private sector that clean energy was the future, and they needed to be all in. Autoworkers, steelworkers and the automakers were now ready to come to the table, alongside climate advocates, farmers, workers, environmental justice activists, and more.Then, we secured the historic Inflation Reduction Act — the most aggressive action on climate in U.S. history. When Mr. Obama took office, there were 500 charging stations nationwide. Now, thanks to President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we plan to install 500,000 chargers across the country. Every major automaker signed on to the president’s goal of achieving 50 percent E.V. sales nationwide by 2030, a goal considered laughable just two years ago.The United States is now becoming a magnet for clean energy innovation and investment. Since President Biden took office, companies have invested nearly $85 billion in manufacturing of electric vehicles, batteries and E.V. chargers in the United States. The United States is now on track to triple domestic solar manufacturing capacity by 2024, and in 2021 alone, investors announced $2.2 billion in new funding for offshore wind supply chains.But make no mistake: We have a long way to go. The task of completely reshaping our economy is daunting, especially in a country as vast and complex as ours.Take the U.S. manufacturing sector, which produces materials like steel and cement, which are critical to rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure. It has relied on a fossil-fuel based system for nearly 200 years, so reshaping the system means ensuring that these industrial workers get the training and resources to build the clean energy economy.Now, we have a “Buy Clean” initiative, which includes the support of the steelworkers union, to leverage the federal government’s procurement power for low-carbon steel, concrete, asphalt and glass. The challenge before us is aligning these huge supply chains, from the buyers to the sellers, in a way that allows us to run faster.While America has made tremendous progress, we need a harmonized global effort to confront climate change. When I see one-third of Pakistan submerged by extreme flooding, or over 700 million people globally without access to power, I am alarmed by how these basic challenges to human health and wellness will make the transition away from fossil fuels hard. The shift in America is not easily replicated in many parts of the world. And to get where we need to go, we need the entire world to run together.The road is still long, and progress will be uneven. But as I leave my post in the White House, I am optimistic that America is now poised to lead this decisive decade.Gina McCarthy is the departing national climate adviser and a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Glenn Youngkin Knows Exactly What He’s Doing</title>
	<author>Jamelle Bouie</author>
	<body>It’s obvious. Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia, wants to be president.Within months of taking office, Youngkin had already established two political organizations, Spirit of Virginia and America’s Spirit, meant to raise his profile in national Republican politics with donations and assistance to candidates both in his home state and across the country. In July, he met privately with major conservative donors in New York City, underlining the sense that his ambitions run larger than his term in Richmond.Youngkin, a former private equity executive, is on a tour of the country, speaking and raising money for Republican candidates in key presidential swing states. And as he crisscrosses the United States in support of the Republican Party, Youngkin is neither avoiding Donald Trump nor scorning his acolytes; he’s embracing them.In Nevada last week, Youngkin stumped for Joe Lombardo, the Trump-backed Republican nominee for governor who acknowledges that President Biden won the election but says he is worried about the “sanctity of the voting system.” In Michigan, Youngkin stumped for Tudor Dixon, the Trump-backed Republican nominee for governor who has repeatedly challenged the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. And later this month, in Arizona, Youngkin will stump for Kari Lake, the Trump-backed Republican nominee for governor who accused Democrats of fraud in the state and says that unlike Gov. Doug Ducey, she “would not have certified” the 2020 election results.Whether Youngkin agrees with any of this himself is an open question. In the 2021 Virginia Republican primary, he flirted with election denialism but never fully committed. What matters, for our purposes, is that Youngkin believes he needs to cater to and actually support election questioners and deniers to have a shot at leading the Republican Party.You can sense, in conversations about the present and future of the Republican Party, a hope that there is some way to force the party off its current, anti-democratic path. You could see it in the outrage over Democratic Party “meddling” in Republican primaries. As the conservative columnist Henry Olsen wrote for The Washington Post in July, “True friends of democracy would seek to build new alliances that cross old partisan boundaries.”What Youngkin — a more polished and ostensibly moderate Republican politician — aptly demonstrates is that this is false. The issue is that Republican voters want MAGA candidates, and ambitious Republicans see no path to power that doesn’t treat election deniers and their supporters as partners in arms.There is an analogy to make here to the midcentury Democratic Party, which was torn between a liberal, Northern, pro-civil rights faction and a reactionary, Southern, segregationist faction. The analogy is useful, not because the outcome of the struggle is instructive in this case, but because the reason the liberal faction prevailed helps illustrate why anti-MAGA Republicans are fighting a losing battle.In 1948, the mayor of Minneapolis — 37-year-old Hubert Humphrey — called on the hundreds of delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to add a strong civil rights plank to the party’s national platform. “To those who say we are rushing this issue of civil rights,” Humphrey said, “I say to them we are 172 years late.”“The time has arrived for the Democratic Party to get out of the shadow of states’ rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights,” Humphrey added.As the historian Michael Kazin notes in “What It Took to Win: A History of the Democratic Party,” both “the speech and the ebullient, and quite spontaneous, floor demonstration that followed helped convince a majority of delegates — and President Truman, reluctantly — to include the civil rights pledge in the platform.”But there were dissenters. A small number of Southern delegates left the convention in protest. Calling themselves the States’ Rights Democratic Party, they organized a challenge to Truman with Gov. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina at the top of their ticket.These “Dixiecrats” were anti-civil rights and, for good measure, anti-labor. “We stand for the segregation of the races and the racial integrity of each race, the constitutional right to choose one’s associates; to accept private employment without governmental interference, and to earn one’s living in any lawful way,” reads the States’ Rights Democratic platform, unanimously adopted at their convention in Oklahoma City the next month. We favor, they continued, “home-rule, local self-government and a minimum of interference with individual rights.”Of course, this meant the maintenance of Jim Crow, the subversion of the constitutional guarantees embedded in the 14th and 15th Amendments, and the continued domination of Black Americans by a tyrannical planter-industrial elite.From its inception in the late 1820s as the movement to elect Andrew Jackson president, the Democratic Party relied on the Solid South to win national elections. Now it had a choice. Democrats could reject their new civil rights plank, accommodate the Dixiecrats and fight with a unified front against a hungry and energetic Republican Party, shut out of power since Herbert Hoover’s defeat in 1932. Or they could scorn the so-called States’ Rights Democrats and run as a liberal party committed to equal rights and opportunity for all Americans.They chose the latter and changed American politics forever. And while much of this choice was born of sincere belief, we also should not ignore the powerful force of demographic change.From 1915 to 1965, more than six million Black Americans left their homes in the agrarian South to settle in the cities of the industrial North, from New York and Chicago to Philadelphia and Detroit and beyond.Their arrival marked the beginning of a tectonic shift in American political life. “The difference in laws between the North and the South created a political coming-of-age for Black migrants,” the political scientist Keneshia N. Grant writes in “The Great Migration and the Democratic Party: Black Voters and the Realignment of American Politics in the 20th Century.” “Seeing political participation as a badge of honor and hallmark of success in northern life, migrants registered to vote in large numbers. Northern parties and candidates worked to gain Black support through their election campaigns, and the parties expected Black voters to turn out to vote for their nominees on Election Day.”For a Democratic Party whose national fortunes rested on control of urban machines, Black voters could mean the difference between four years in power and four years in the wilderness. With the rise of Franklin Roosevelt, who won an appreciable share of the Black vote in the 1932 presidential election, Northern Democratic politicians began to pay real attention to the interests of Black Americans in cities across the region.By 1948, most Black Americans who could vote were reliable partners in the New Deal coalition, which gave liberals in the Democratic Party some of the political space they needed to buck Jim Crow. Yes, the Dixiecrats would withdraw their support. But for every white vote Harry Truman might lose in Alabama and Mississippi, there was a Black vote he might gain in Ohio and California, the two states that ultimately gave him his victory over the fearsome former prosecutor (and New York governor) Thomas Dewey.Not only did the Dixiecrat rebellion fail; it also demonstrated without a shadow of a doubt that Democrats could win national elections without the Solid South. The segregationists were weaker than they looked, and over the next 20 years the Democratic Party would cast them aside. (And even then, with the Dixiecrat exodus, Truman still won most of the states of the former Confederacy.)There is no equivalent to northern Black voters in the Trumpified Republican Party. Put differently, there is no large and pivotal group of Republicans who can exert cross-pressure on MAGA voters. Instead, the further the Republican Party goes down the rabbit hole of “stop the steal” and other conspiracy theories, the more it loses voters who could apply that pressure.In a normal, more majoritarian political system, this dynamic would eventually fix the issue of the MAGA Republican Party. Parties want to win, and they will almost always shift gears when it’s clear they can’t with their existing platform, positions and leadership.The problem is that the American political system, in its current configuration, gives much of its power to the party with the most supporters in all the right places. Republicans may have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections, but key features in the system — equal state representation in the Senate, malapportionment in the House of Representatives and winner-take-all distribution of votes in the Electoral College (Nebraska and Maine notwithstanding) — gives them a powerful advantage on the playing field of national politics.To put it in simple terms, Joe Biden won the national popular vote by seven million ballots in the 2020 presidential election, but if not for roughly 120,000 votes across four states — Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — Donald Trump would still be president.Which is all to say that someone like Glenn Youngkin is only doing what makes sense. To make MAGA politics weak among Republican politicians, you have to make MAGA voters irrelevant in national elections. But that will take a different political system — or a vastly different political landscape — than the one we have now.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>What Comes Next in the Fed’s Fight Against Inflation?</title>
	<author>Jeanna Smialek</author>
	<body>The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver a third straight supersize interest rate increase this week as it wages its most aggressive fight against inflation since the 1980s — and it could signal even more to come.Central bankers are widely expected to raise interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point at their meeting on Wednesday, and investors think there is even a small chance of a full percentage-point move.But Wall Street is more focused on what comes next. Officials will release updated economic forecasts for the first time since June after their two-day meeting this week. Those are expected to show a more forceful path ahead for rates than Fed officials previously anticipated as rapid inflation continues to plague America. The question is just how much more assertive the Fed will be.Central bankers have already raised interest rates considerably in an attempt to slow the economy and temper price increases. Business activity is slowing in response, but it is not falling off a cliff: Employers continue to hire, wages are rising, and inflation has remained stubbornly quick.That has prompted officials to reinforce in speeches that they are serious about getting price increases under control, even if doing so comes at a cost to growth and the labor market. It’s an inflation-focused tone that many on Wall Street refer to as “hawkish.”The economic projections could give policymakers the chance to underline that commitment.“Things are not quite evolving as they had expected — they’re having trouble slowing the economy,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities. “At the end of the day, there is very little they can do this week but sound hawkish.”Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will hold a news conference after the release, and is likely to echo his pledge late last month to do what it takes to wrestle prices lower.That could be a painful process, Mr. Powell has acknowledged. Higher interest rates temper inflation by making it more expensive to borrow money, discouraging both consumption and business expansions. That weighs on wage growth and can even push unemployment higher. Firms cannot charge as much in a slowing economy, and inflation cools down.“While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” Mr. Powell said last month. He later added, “We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done.”If the Fed continues raising rates along the trajectory that economists and investors increasingly expect, the fallout could be painful. In the early 1980s, the last time inflation was as high as it is today, the central bank under Paul A. Volcker jerked borrowing costs sharply higher and mired the economy in a recession that sent joblessness to double-digit levels. Homebuilders mailed Mr. Volcker two-by-fours from buildings they could not build; car dealers sent keys from cars they could not sell.A toll on borrowers. The Federal Reserve has been raising the federal funds rate, its key interest rate, as it tries to rein in inflation. By raising the rate, which is what banks charge one another for overnight loans, the Fed sets off a ripple effect. Whether directly or indirectly, a number of borrowing costs for consumers go up.Consumer loans. Changes in credit card rates will closely track the Fed’s moves, so consumers can expect to pay more on any revolving debt. Car loan rates are expected to rise, too. Private student loan borrowers should also expect to pay more.Mortgages. Mortgage rates don’t move in lock step with the federal funds rate, but track the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, which is influenced by inflation and how investors expect the Fed to react to rising prices. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have climbed above 6 percent for the first time since 2008, according to Freddie Mac.Banks. An increase in the Fed benchmark rate often means banks will pay more interest on deposits. Larger banks are less likely to pay consumers more, and online banks have already started raising some of their rates.This year’s rate increases are not as severe. The Fed has raised rates from near zero in March to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent, and this week’s expected move would take that to 3 to 3.25 percent. If the central bank raises rates as much as investors expect over the coming months, they will end the year well above 4 percent. In the 1980s, rates jumped to about 19 percent from 9 percent.Still, four full percentage points of rate increases in 10 months would be the fastest policy adjustment since Mr. Volcker’s campaign — and while Fed policymakers have been hoping that they can let the economy down gently and without causing a painful recession, economists have warned that a benign outcome is less and less likely.That central bank has emphasized that it has an obligation to get inflation back in check.The Fed has two economic goals: maximum employment and stable inflation around 2 percent. While unemployment is currently very low, prices are increasing at more than three times the target rate based on the Fed’s preferred measure and remained stubbornly rapid and broad in August.As inflation has lingered month after month, the Fed has repeatedly ramped up its response. It lifted rates a quarter point in March, a half point in May and three-quarters of a point at each of its past two meetings. Like investors, many economists think that a full percentage-point move is possible but not likely this week.A big reason for raising rates quickly is to convince businesses and consumers that the central bank is committed to reining in rapid price increases. If workers begin to believe that inflation will last, they may push for higher wages to cover their costs, which employers then pass onto customers in the form of higher prices, setting off an upward spiral.The Fed has recently received good news on that front: Inflation expectations have been edging down. That may be one reason the central bank will opt for a three-quarter-point move rather than a larger adjustment at this meeting, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan.“This isn’t about managing psychology — this is about slowing economic activity, which can be done at a more methodical pace,” he said.That’s why Wall Street is likely to be especially attuned to the Fed’s interest rate forecasts for the rest of 2022 and beyond.Those projections are often called a “dot plot” because the release shows individual policymakers’ anonymous forecasts arrayed as blue dots on a graphical plot. Officials forecast in June that they would lift interest rates to 3.4 percent this year — a number they’ve nearly reached already, suggesting that the forecast is in for an upward revision.They also projected that they would lift interest rates to 3.8 percent next year before bringing them back down. As inflation has lingered, economists have come to expect that peak rate to move higher.The new level will send a signal about how forcefully the central bank is planning to clamp down on the economy. Fed officials want to adjust policy with enough vigor to bring inflation under control but without overdoing their rate moves and inflicting more pain on the economy than necessary.Striking the correct balance could be tough. Fed policy takes time to trickle through the economy. While rate increases have already begun to weigh on the housing market and growth overall is beginning to slow, the full impact of the central bank’s recent moves could take time to be felt.“The faster the Fed hikes rates, the less likely a soft landing becomes,” Mr. Goldberg said, because officials are not waiting to see how their moves play out. “It’s very much akin to realizing you missed your exit on the highway a mile back.”Given that risk and how much rates have already moved this year, many economists expect that the Fed may soon want to slow down the increases.Mr. Goldberg expects one more three-quarter-point move in November, then a pullback to a half-point move in December. Economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note this week that they expected the Fed to raise interest rates half a point at each of the next two meetings after this one, so that the federal funds rate will end the year in a range of 4 to 4.25 percent.The slowdown will come “because the funds rate will be at a higher level, concern about overtightening will eventually rise, and the drop in consumer inflation expectations should reduce concern about unanchoring,” the Goldman economists wrote.But officials have repeatedly signaled that even after they slow and eventually stop rate increases, they plan to leave borrowing costs at a high and economy-restricting level for some time.“Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to provide confidence that inflation is moving down to target,” Lael Brainard, the Fed’s vice chair, said in a recent speech.Given that, central bankers may also pencil lower growth and higher unemployment into their economic forecasts this week, in an acknowledgment that their policies are likely to weigh on the economy.Investors, who have at times doubted whether the Fed would really hurt the economy, have recently become more concerned about the rate policy and economic outlook. A grim set of projections could reassert to them how stern the central bank’s inflation fight has become.“The market has taken them seriously,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale. “The Fed has been as hawkish as they possibly can be.”</body>

	<title>Mini to Maestro, Part 3: Advanced Puzzles</title>
	<author>Isaac Aronow</author>
	<body>Welcome to Part 3 of “Mini to Maestro.” If you’re here, you’ve made it through the gantlet of themed puzzles and are looking to try out some themeless grids. If this doesn’t sound like you, you can check out Part 1 of our guide, where we go over the basics of solving, or Part 2, where we go over some intermediate tips and help you get into the habit of solving often.To refresh your memory, your guides are Jackie Frere, community engagement manager, and Isaac Aronow, associate editor of Gameplay. In this part, we’ll be going over how to attack the Friday and Saturday themeless puzzles, as well as a few notes on Sunday. Yes, these are difficult, but you’ll be able to solve them in no time.On Friday and Saturday, we typically run into a different type of puzzle: the themeless kind. The name is self-explanatory: It’s a grid with no theme answers. As far as the difficulty goes, Will Shortz, editor of the New York Times Crossword, said in an email that “themeless crosswords aren’t inherently harder than themed ones.” But he added that they “tend to be harder than themed ones, because they have longer answers, especially ones that have rarely or never appeared in crosswords before.”The added answer length is built in, as The Times has a lower word limit for themeless puzzles — 72, compared with 78 for themed ones — and it’s not at all unusual to see puzzles go even lower. Because of the added space, themeless puzzles are afforded more room for fresher answers, which moves the needle toward their being naturally harder to solve. Just how difficult do they get? Sam Ezersky, a digital puzzles editor, said, “We save our fireworks for Friday and Saturday, if you will.”The other factor is that in themed puzzles, the construction is limited by the theme itself. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing — sometimes an excellent theme takes a puzzle from just good to great — but it means that constructors often end up using similar fill, or nonthemed, answers in a themed crossword. After you’ve solved a lot of puzzles, you’re bound to start recognizing these as they come up, and they don’t surprise you in the same way an answer like GAY PORN or COINKYDINK might.Don’t worry too much if this is making your head spin. You can use the skills you’ve already learned from the puzzles you solved earlier in the week to help you solve a themeless. First, find something you know and build from there. There are still plenty of three- to five-letter answers in any Friday or Saturday puzzle, and odds are you already know the answer to at least one or two of them. Second, there aren’t really any new types of clues at the end of the week, but they tend to lean even more on misdirection.Will gave us the example of a simple clue like “Light,” which can be a noun, a verb or an adjective. It’s hard to answer clues like that if you don’t have a crossing answer. “Light” has appeared in New York Times Crosswords 22 times since 1993, according to XWordInfo.com, an online database of New York Times Crossword puzzles. On April 18, 2006, a Tuesday, the answer was AIRY. On April 30, 2004, a Friday, the answer was LAMP. On April 30, 2016, a Saturday, the answer was SET ABLAZE. So you’ll have to use your solving skills to try to figure out which meaning the puzzle is asking you for, but it’s nothing you haven’t already done.At this point, you may be asking yourself, What makes a Saturday harder than a Friday? It’s a very fair question, especially since there are no themes in these puzzles to help. Looking at XWordInfo.com, we found that Saturday puzzles have the lowest word counts, the fewest black squares and the longest average word lengths. From that data, we can infer that Saturdays are harder than Fridays.But does that mean that Saturday is always going to be a huge challenge while Friday is just going to be a bit tough? Not necessarily. It’s important to note that while themeless puzzles come in all levels of difficulty, The Times publishes ones that are harder to fit into the Monday-to-Saturday difficulty curve. Some solvers may also find that, in a given week, Friday is actually harder than Saturday. Isaac, who loves themeless puzzles, says it can be a tossup. Jackie says that she finds both equally hard but that she enjoys a good challenge.Often, it really just comes down to what you know as a solver, and not necessarily the contents of the puzzle itself. The construction of Saturday puzzles, which is often more complex, means they tend to be harder, but if Friday is full of obscure trivia and Saturday is full of clues you’re familiar with, you’ll probably have an easier time with the purportedly harder puzzle.In our experience, this isn’t incredibly common, but it does happen every now and then. You’re not weird if, in a given week, you struggle through a Friday only to quickly fill in a Saturday. It happens more often than you think. Try out a few Fridays yourself, and then try out some Saturdays. Let us know which ones you find harder.Let’s solve the themeless puzzle from Friday, May 13, 2022 together:Here are five Fridays that Wyna Liu, crossword editor, recommends:Feb. 18, 2022Sept. 3, 2021Sept. 10, 2021July 9, 2021April 2, 2021Here are five Saturday puzzles we recommend:May 14, 2022April 23, 2022April 9, 2022Sept. 18, 2021July 24, 2021Sunday puzzles are the biggest of the week, but not necessarily the hardest. They are 21x21 instead of 15x15, and in nearly all cases, they are themed. They don’t introduce any new concepts, and the clues aren’t notably more difficult than any other themed puzzle.Sundays do take longer to solve than other puzzles, but that’s more likely a consequence of their size rather than their difficulty. They aren’t much more than a big Wednesday, so if you can solve a regular Wednesday puzzle, you should have no trouble getting through Sunday.What makes Sunday special is that for many, it was an event when someone in their home was solving one. Often, people learn to solve crossword puzzles because people they love do so. “There’s a lot of variety, but at the end of the day, it’s a kind of puzzle where there’s going to be something for everybody,” Sam said. “It’s a great one to solve with family around the kitchen table.”A challenge for you: Grab a group of friends or family members and see if you can solve a Sunday together. You never know what kind of information you will all bring to the puzzle. It’s a great way to get others involved in your practice.Here are five Sundays that Catilin Lovinger, a Wordplay columnist, recommends:June 27, 2021Feb. 28, 2021May 30, 2021March 27, 2022July 5, 2020See, you can do these! There’s no right or wrong way to solve a puzzle. Feel free to use autocheck, look up an answer, phone a friend or do whatever feels right for you. The key thing to remember here is that crossword puzzles are games, and they’re meant to be fun. Sure, they can be difficult, and sometimes even exasperating — but over time, crossword puzzles can become an engaging and rewarding part of your day.These guides are meant to get you started on your crossword journey.

	<title>Film Club: ‘What the Pandemic Can Teach Us About Endings’</title>
	<author>The Learning Network</author>
	<body>We have all been waiting a long time for the pandemic to end. For masks, restrictions, boosters and canceled plans to once and for all come to a close.“What the Pandemic Can Teach Us About Endings” is a four-minute animated film that explores our all-too-human need for closure and Hollywood endings.

	<title>Mini to Maestro, Part 2: Intermediate Solving</title>
	<author>Isaac Aronow</author>
	<body>Welcome to Part 2 of “Mini to Maestro.” If you’ve made it this far, that means you know the Mini like the back of your hand, have conquered Mondays and are comfortable with Tuesday puzzles. If you have no idea what we’re talking about or want a little more practice, check out Part 1 of our guide, where we go over the basics of the New York Times Crossword and getting into the habit of solving.As a reminder, your tour guides are Jackie Frere, community engagement manager, and Isaac Aronow, associate editor of Gameplay. In this section, we’ll be tackling Wednesday and Thursday crossword puzzles. Thursdays, some of our crossword editors may say, are the hardest, but the most satisfying, puzzles to solve. Let’s begin.We’re not going to sugarcoat it for you: The middle of the week is a turning point in difficulty level. The themes become more complex, the clues get trickier, and you might find yourself going, “Huh?” more times that you might be comfortable with.We covered a few basic clue types in Part 1, and before we get into some more specific tips, we want to note here that you’ll still see the same types of clues as you would on Monday or Tuesday. What’s different is that they’ll be used in a way that involves just a little more misdirection to try to throw you off. That, in combination with the new clue types we’re about to show you, is part of what raises the difficulty level of Wednesday and Thursday puzzles.Now, let’s break down a few more advanced clues that may pop up in common Wednesday puzzles. One devious type of clue to look out for is the question-mark clue. For example, if you see a question mark in the clue “Web site?” you can assume that some wordplay will be involved. An animal might have webbed TOES, so the clue refers to the “site” of the webbing.Another difficult clue type can be seen inside quotes. If part of a clue is placed in quotation marks, it could be the name of a movie, a book or a song. However, it could also be an expression. For example, if the clue says, “‘That’s good thinking!’” you can infer that the answer is most likely a synonym for the phrase. So the answer is NEATIDEA. Similarly, if a clue is in brackets, such as “[OMG!],” the answer would be GASP in response or reaction.Fun fact: You may have heard that Sunday is the hardest day of the New York Times Crossword, but really, it tends to solve more like a larger Wednesday puzzle.We have to add in a note that it’s OK to take a break from solving. We admit we had to. In case you hadn’t heard, we bought Wordle, so our team got a little busy. When Jackie came back to Wednesdays, she felt a little stuck and needed to restart with Mondays and Tuesdays. Life gets in the way; don’t be afraid to work your way back up and massage your brain to get back into the solving groove if you need to.Now that we’ve got that out of the way, practice more Wednesday puzzles than you think you might need. Got the hang of it? Buckle up for Thursdays.Here are five Wednesdays that Tracy Bennett, crossword editor, recommends:July 8, 2020Aug. 4, 2021Sept. 1, 2021Feb. 16, 2022Dec. 23, 2020Yes, Thursday is the most difficult themed puzzle published by The Times every week. But you’ll have it conquered in no time with a little practice and prep work. Reminder: Puzzles on Mondays through Thursdays contain themes, which are often found in the puzzle’s longest answers or when groups of entries have something in common.We’ve already covered some of the more complex clue types that show up in midweek and late-week puzzles, but we’ll go over a few difficult theme types here. This isn’t an exhaustive list, but it will cover a handful of the more devious ones:Spoonerism themes are based on phrases where the sounds are reversed. Think “Court of Paul” instead of “port of call.”Themes centered on the deletion of a letter or sound from a word. For example, “coil” becomes “oil” by dropping the first letter of the word.Themes with entries that go outside the edges of the grid.And, of course, no list of complex themes would be complete without mention of the dreaded rebus. A rebus element is one in which several letters are put into one square. Here’s how to do it.Puzzles that feature a rebus are relatively uncommon, but they are an important part of the crossword puzzle ecosystem. They can usually be spotted when an answer is a phrase that doesn’t seem to fit in the number of squares an entry takes up. For the record, Jackie hates any puzzle that contains a rebus. Isaac thinks they’re fun, but the two of us agree on one thing: They’re very tricky.One question that can come up when we talk to new Thursday solvers is, “If Thursday is the most difficult themed puzzle of the week, does that make it the most difficult puzzle of the week overall?” A hard theme can make a puzzle harder than a puzzle without one, in some cases. For Isaac, it can take him longer to solve a hard Thursday than a Friday some weeks, but on average, Friday will be harder. We’ll get into what makes themeless puzzles so tricky in Part 3.Let’s solve the Thursday from Apr. 28, 2022 together:Remember, there’s nothing wrong with revealing or looking up an answer if you need help. If it were cheating, we wouldn’t give you the tools to do it. And in the same vein, it’s OK if you don’t know every answer in the puzzle. Part of the fun of crossword puzzles, at least for us, is that they’re a great avenue for learning new things.Maybe you’ll find a new song you’ve never listened to before, or you’ll learn about an actor whose movies you’ll love. Be gentle with yourself, and don’t worry too much if you can’t do it. Crossword puzzles are hard, and that’s part of the adventure, but you should make sure you’re having fun first. Try out some Thursdays for a while and see how you do. When you’re ready to tackle a themeless, move on to Part 3.Here are five Thursdays that Deb Amlen, senior Gameplay editor, recommends:Jan. 6, 2021Feb. 3, 2022March 3, 2022March 24, 2022March 31, 2022</body>

	<title>It’s Never Too Late to ‘Fly’ on a Trapeze</title>
	<author>Abby Ellin</author>
	<body>It’s Never Too Late is a series about people who decide to pursue their dreams on their own terms.There are people who dream of directing a play or a movie. The director Tom Moore has done both. But he has always dreamed of “flying.”“It was a childhood fantasy,” said Mr. Moore, 79, a film, TV and theater director whose credits include the original Broadway production of “Grease” and the Pulitzer Prize-winning play “’Night, Mother.”“I liked the circus, but loved the ultimate act, which was the trapeze,” he said. “I would wait for that.”But Mr. Moore never thought he had the athletic ability to swing, stretch out, then fly from a long horizontal bar, often 30 feet in the air. He wasn’t good at baseball, and, at 5 feet 7 inches and 150 pounds, he was too small for football at West Lafayette High School, in Indiana. “I just assumed I was not good at sports,” he said.So instead of running off to join the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, Mr. Moore, who grew up in Meridian, Miss., before moving to Indiana, went to the Yale School of Drama. He did rather well, with “Grease” on Broadway back in 1972, which ran for more than 3,300 performances; the show “Over Here!” with the newcomers John Travolta, Marilu Henner and Treat Williams; and the play “’Night, Mother,” which he also directed for the 1986 film starring Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft.His TV credits include episodes of the 1980s drama “Thirtysomething,” “ER,” “Felicity” and “Ally McBeal.” Along the way he was nominated for two Tonys and three Emmys. (More recently, he coedited the book “Grease, Tell Me More, Tell Me More,” for the Broadway show’s 50th anniversary this year.)Around the age of 50, after the demise of a relationship, he was looking for new adventures. (He is single now and cheekily describes his longtime partners as “a series of valued novellas rather than the one great American novel.”) In 1996, while on vacation at the now-defunct resort Club Med in Playa Blanca, Mexico, he was drawn to a trapeze rig on the beach, and signed up.Trapeze was a perfect blend of theatricality and athleticism, and he loved it. He made a “catch” — that is, he managed to grasp the bar in midair — on his first try, and even took part in a show at the end of the week.This spoke to his nascent acting ambitions. “I was never a good actor,” he admitted. “Acting is all about revealing and opening oneself up, and I couldn’t do it.” But he was a performer.He “flew” a few more times at another Club Med in Huatulco, Mexico, over the next year, and decided he wanted to incorporate his holiday pastime into real life. By then he was living in the Hollywood Hills, still directing but feeling somewhat restless, and he asked around for names of trapeze teachers. One kept popping up: Richie Gaona, who came from a famous trapeze family, the Flying Gaonas. Mr. Moore wasn’t sure Mr. Gaona would work with an amateur, but Mr. Gaona agreed. And so, he began learning trapeze in earnest on a rig in Mr. Gaona’s backyard in the San Fernando Valley, about a 40-minute drive from Mr. Moore’s home.“I learned everything from Richie,” he said. “He was amazing. And then I was into it big time and would go three to four times a week.”He got so immersed in the art of trapeze that he ended up making a documentary about the Gaona family called “The Flight Fantastic.”“I think I did things a bit backward because I was so passionately involved in my work and building a career, I didn’t explore the athletic side of me until late,” said Mr. Moore, who considers himself an intermediate amateur. “Sometimes people say, ‘Oh, you’re a trapeze artist.’ I’m nothing of the kind. It’s a sport for me and fun, but I know the skill and talent required to practice the art of trapeze.” (The following interview has been condensed and edited.)What’s your favorite thing about the sport?You can’t think about anything else on the trapeze. If you think about anything else, you’ll fail. That’s a great escape in itself.What’s the hardest thing about the trapeze?Swinging on the bar is the preparation for all tricks that one does on the trapeze. The stronger it is, the higher it is and the more precise it is, the better the trick. It takes a long time to learn to swing. Timing is everything. People think you need strength to do it. Men particularly try to muscle up, but that’s not really it. It’s all about timing and grace. Trapeze at its best is more of a dance in the air.Have you ever gotten hurt?I once had an accident. People think you have a net so you’re fine, but the net can be the most dangerous part. You have to land on your back. If you come in on your legs and feet or knees, you’ll bounce wildly out of the net. You can get severely hurt. The safety lines were holding me back from extra height, so I took them off for a trick, but I was so excited that as I was coming into the net, I was landing on my stomach. I was in the middle of flipping over to my back and I didn’t make it all the way. I bounced extraordinarily high into the air and I came down on the ridge rope, the edges of the net, face first. It sliced through my entire nose all the way to the cartilage underneath.A friend handed me a towel and said, “Put this over your face.” I thought she was trying to stop the bleeding, but everyone was so traumatized by my face. I had done some real damage. An amazing surgeon was able to do the work, a reconstruction of the nose. Mind you, I had done this without telling anyone I was going to do it, or I would never have been allowed. So, I deserved what I got.How often do you trapeze these days?Maybe once a month. Twenty-five years ago I was willing to sacrifice anything — even time in my career — to get to trapeze, but one matures, even in trapeze. I go when I feel like it rather than on a regular schedule. I’d like to be as good as I was at 60 when I was doing it all the time and when I had a big trapeze birthday party for 250. But I’m not, and that’s OK. But I don’t have any intention of giving it up because I still enjoy doing it.Do the physical demands of trapeze take a toll?Any time I’m away from it and go back, I hurt. As you get older, it’s the joints. They’re in more pain. It’s not as easy as it used to be, but I don’t want to ever stop because I know that once I stop I won’t go back. If you keep doing it, then your body gets used to it.I always practice my hardest trick first, because it requires everything I have to give. I’m telling my body, “This is what you have to do.” It’s like going into the water, whether you edge out inch by inch or plunge right in. It’s better for me to plunge in.What has trapeze given you on an emotional level?My athletic pursuits have given me a great sense of self. Many people my age have long ago retired to observation. They’re no longer a participant. I don’t feel that way at all. Attitude, spirit for life, capacity for curiosity and joy are the most important things one can have.I just keep doing what I can do, and fortunately that seems to be quite a bit.I feel my whole life has been reinvention when needed, which I think is a fantastic way to keep staying young. There’s always something new if one stays open to it.</body>

	<title>Railroads’ Strategy Thrilled Wall Street, but Not Customers and Workers</title>
	<author>Peter Eavis</author>
	<body>America’s first commercial railroads were built almost two centuries ago. Freight rail has been a symbol of the nation’s economic might and ingenuity ever since.In recent years, some of the biggest names on Wall Street have made significant investments in railroads, reaping big stock gains as railroads reported higher profits. But the underlying strategies that strengthened railroads’ bottom lines have caused friction with customers, regulators and particularly workers — giving rise to a contract dispute that threatened a nationwide shutdown of the railway system.After losing ground to trucking in the mid-20th century, the rail industry managed to recover through decades of consolidation and a push for efficiency. Critics say those same dynamics created a system with thin staffing and minimal competition, making it particularly vulnerable to shocks like the coronavirus pandemic.“It’s a trend that’s been going on for years,” said Martin J. Oberman, the chairman of the Surface Transportation Board, the federal agency charged with regulating freight railways. “The pendulum swung pretty far and it allowed these people to exercise tremendous power over their customers and over their labor force.”The efficiency drive began in the 1990s. It spread slowly before reaching most of the major American railroads over the past five years.“They all are doing the same thing roughly at this point, but they started at different times,” said Colin Scarola, an analyst at the research firm CFRA who covers railway stocks. “Once this success started coming through, the copycat effect really took hold.”The strategy is evident in head count, which has fallen at nearly all of the major railway companies in the United States and Canada. At CSX, for example, the number of employees plunged by a third over the past decade. This helped expand the company’s profit margins, and its stock is up over 300 percent since the end of 2011, far exceeding gains in the wider stock market.Last year, the seven major railways based in the United States and Canada — which include CSX — had combined net income of $27 billion, up from $15 billion a decade earlier. Over the past decade, the six of those seven railways that were publicly traded paid out $146 billion in stock buybacks and dividends, which is over $30 billion more cash than they invested in their businesses.For the employees who remain, pay has risen. At the four biggest U.S. railways, pay and benefits per employee rose by 26 percent over the past decade, slightly ahead of inflation, according to an analysis of the companies’ financial filings.But employees say the reductions in staffing have resulted in more punishing schedules. Restrictive policies have kept them from seeking routine medical care, spending time with their families and otherwise living their lives, they say.Those complaints were at the center of the contract impasse that left tens of thousands of workers prepared to walk off the job last week. A strike could have been economically devastating, paralyzing shipments of grain, chemicals and other cargo.It was averted with less than a day to go when the Biden administration helped to broker a tentative agreement that addresses some of those issues and will be put to a vote of the rail unions’ members in the coming weeks.The freight rail industry says it has worked hard to adapt to rapid changes — including the pandemic and, before that, a decline in demand for coal, a critical source of business.“The industry has had to continually evolve to grow its other services,” said Ian Jefferies, the president of the Association of American Railroads, an industry group. To make up for the decline in coal, freight shippers have tried to transport more grain, truck trailers, shipping containers and other goods, he said.The industry’s need for reinvention is nothing new. In the 1950s, the nation began building interstate highways, allowing trucks to move goods at faster speeds, at the expense of rail.By 1980, railroads were struggling. That year, Congress passed the Staggers Act, deregulating the industry, freeing railroads from price controls and paving the way for mergers. By 2000, there were only seven major railroads, down from dozens two decades earlier.Today, those seven carriers employ 88 percent of all freight rail workers and earn 94 percent of industry revenues, according to Mr. Jefferies’s group. Two carriers, BNSF Railway and Union Pacific, are pre-eminent in the Western United States, while Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation hold sway in the East. The others — Canadian Pacific, Canadian National and Kansas City Southern — serve the middle of the country. (A proposed $31 billion merger between Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern is under federal review.)The early years of deregulation were good for the industry.“The railroads turned around really quickly and started to sign contracts with big shippers,” said Gerard McCullough, a retired economics professor at the University of Minnesota and expert on the industry. “Some of that money enabled them to still provide service to smaller shippers and pretty much everybody benefited.”As they consolidated, freight carriers became more productive and benefited from the ability to add more traffic on existing networks. Customers, too, saw benefits: From 1985 to 2004, rail rates — measured as revenue per ton per mile — fell more than 40 percent, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Surface Transportation Board, which monitors and regulates rates.Prices started to increase in the early 2000s, driven by rising costs for labor, fuel, materials and supplies as well as a growing focus on profitability. From 2002 to 2019, long-distance trucking rates increased by 40 percent, according to a Transportation Department report published this year, while rail rates grew by 96 percent, though they are still well below historical levels, adjusted for inflation.Many industries saw their shipping options dwindle, although regulators had been careful to try to limit the concentration of power by imposing conditions on mergers that would have reduced competition, or rejecting them outright. “No merger has allowed a shipper to go from two railroads to one,” the railroad industry group said in a statement.As the industry strove for efficiency, one approach in particular attracted anger from customers and workers and praise and attention from Wall Street.That system, known as precision scheduled railroading, focused on running rigid, consistent schedules, streamlining processes and routes, and cutting back on equipment and employees. Like lean manufacturing reforms in other industries, P.S.R. allowed railroads to do more with less, improving efficiency and operating margins.The system was pioneered by a longtime rail industry executive, Hunter Harrison.Mr. Harrison instituted the practice first at Illinois Central Railroad in the 1990s and then at the company to which it was later sold, Canadian National. His success attracted the attention of Bill Ackman, the activist investor, who won a proxy battle for Canadian Pacific in 2012 and installed Mr. Harrison to lead the company.Mr. Harrison brought his approach to Canadian Pacific, then to CSX in 2017, before his death that year. Other freight carriers and Wall Street increasingly took notice, and the practice has spread throughout the industry.Many freight rail experts say P.S.R. brought necessary reforms to the industry, but they also say some practices, which can differ greatly among carriers, went too far or were poorly executed. Unions say the system has created miserable working conditions.At CSX, Mr. Harrison imposed the practice “too quickly, too violently and too undiplomatically,” said Tony Hatch, a longtime rail industry analyst. “Part of that is he had seen it work three times, so he sort of knew what the outcome was going to be.”From Wall Street’s perspective, however, the railways were ripe for an overhaul, and the changes ended up being straightforward and easy to put in place. At its core, precision scheduled railroading focused on having fixed schedules for shipments rather than waiting for a certain amount of coal to be loaded before moving. Another reform included switching from a system in which locomotives typically pulled one type of freight to one in which they might pull a mixture of grain, coal or other goods in intermodal cars — which can switch among trains, trucks and ships — allowing for longer trains and fewer employees.“Really, that’s how simple the changes have been,” said Mr. Scarola of CFRA. “And they’re hugely effective.”Some customers say those changes resulted in worse service. Before the pandemic, many complained that they were having trouble reaching freight sales representatives to sign up and ship more by rail. When they did get through, the shippers complained that the terms they were offered were unacceptable.Traffic plummeted when the pandemic arrived. Like other industries, freight railroads reacted to the uncertainty of the crisis by laying off and furloughing workers, but demand bounced back quickly as consumers started buying goods in great numbers. When railroads invited furloughed workers back, many had decided to leave the industry altogether. Railroads tried to hire replacements, but have faced a tight labor market. Even when they have hired workers, training new employees takes months.That contributed to a decline in service, frustrating freight customers even more. Last year and early this year, ethanol plants halted production as they struggled to bring corn in and get ethanol out, and cars full of grain languished for weeks at production facilities.“I had logistics managers telling me last year, that in their corporations when they go to locate a new facility it used to be they had to locate it on a rail line,” Mr. Oberman of the Surface Transportation Board said. “They said: ‘We don’t do that anymore. We locate on highways.’”But switching to trucking isn’t possible for many shippers, he said. A single train with 100 cars of coal or grain would require hundreds of trucks to replace it. Rail is also much more fuel-efficient. The trucking industry is facing a driver shortage, and many goods, such as hazardous materials, are best suited to trains.The rail industry has improved service somewhat since earlier in the pandemic, as it has hired workers, but shippers are still worried, especially with harvest season ramping up.For all of the turbulence, industry experts are confident about the long-term outlook. Freight railroading has survived for nearly two centuries through constant reinvention. That’s part of what made BNSF an attractive investment for Berkshire Hathaway, as the holding company’s chairman, Warren Buffett, noted in his most recent letter to shareholders.“I’ll venture a rare prediction,” he wrote in February. “BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire and our country a century from now.”Peter S.

	<title>‘Very Harmful’ Lack of Data Blunts U.S. Response to Outbreaks</title>
	<author>Sharon LaFraniere</author>
	<body>ANCHORAGE — After a middle-aged woman tested positive for Covid-19 in January at her workplace in Fairbanks, public health workers sought answers to questions vital to understanding how the virus was spreading in Alaska’s rugged interior.The woman, they learned, had underlying conditions and had not been vaccinated. She had been hospitalized but had recovered. Alaska and many other states have routinely collected that kind of information about people who test positive for the virus. Part of the goal is to paint a detailed picture of how one of the worst scourges in American history evolves and continues to kill hundreds of people daily, despite determined efforts to stop it.But most of the information about the Fairbanks woman — and tens of millions more infected Americans — remains effectively lost to state and federal epidemiologists. Decades of underinvestment in public health information systems has crippled efforts to understand the pandemic, stranding crucial data in incompatible data systems so outmoded that information often must be repeatedly typed in by hand. The data failure, a salient lesson of a pandemic that has killed more than one million Americans, will be expensive and time-consuming to fix.The precise cost in needless illness and death cannot be quantified. The nation’s comparatively low vaccination rate is clearly a major factor in why the United States has recorded the highest Covid death rate among large, wealthy nations. But federal experts are certain that the lack of comprehensive, timely data has also exacted a heavy toll.“It has been very harmful to our response,” said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, who leads the White House effort to control the pandemic. “It’s made it much harder to respond quickly.”Details of the Fairbanks woman’s case were scattered among multiple state databases, none of which connect easily to the others, much less to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal agency in charge of tracking the virus. Nine months after she fell ill, her information was largely useless to epidemiologists because it was impossible to synthesize most of it with data on the roughly 300,000 other Alaskans and the 95 million-plus other Americans who have gotten Covid.Those same antiquated data systems are now hampering the response to the monkeypox outbreak. Once again, state and federal officials are losing time trying to retrieve information from a digital pipeline riddled with huge holes and obstacles.“We can’t be in a position where we have to do this for every disease and every outbreak,” Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the C.D.C. director, said in an interview. “If we have to reinvent the wheel every time we have an outbreak, we will always be months behind.”The federal government invested heavily over the past decade to modernize the data systems of private hospitals and health care providers, doling out more than $38 billion in incentives to shift to electronic health records. That has enabled doctors and health care systems to share information about patients much more efficiently.But while the private sector was modernizing its data operations, state and local health departments were largely left with the same fax machines, spreadsheets, emails and phone calls to communicate.States and localities need $7.84 billion for data modernization over the next five years, according to an estimate by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and other nonprofit groups. Another organization, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, estimates those agencies need nearly $37 billion over the next decade.The pandemic has laid bare the consequences of neglect. Countries with national health systems like Israel and, to a lesser extent, Britain were able to get solid, timely answers to questions such as who is being hospitalized with Covid and how well vaccines are working. American health officials, in contrast, have been forced to make do with extrapolations and educated guesses based on a mishmash of data.Facing the wildfire-like spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant last December, for example, federal officials urgently needed to know whether Omicron was more deadly than the Delta variant that had preceded it, and whether hospitals would soon be flooded with patients. But they could not get the answer from testing, hospitalization or death data, Dr. Walensky said, because it failed to sufficiently distinguish cases by variant.Instead, the C.D.C. asked Kaiser Permanente of Southern California, a large private health system, to analyze its Covid patients. A preliminary study of nearly 70,000 infections from December showed patients hospitalized with Omicron were less likely to be hospitalized, need intensive care or die than those infected with Delta.But that was only a snapshot, and the agency only got it by going hat in hand to a private system. “Why is that the path?” Dr. Walensky asked.The drought of reliable data has also repeatedly left regulators high and dry in deciding whether, when and for whom additional shots of coronavirus vaccine should be authorized. Such decisions turn on how well the vaccines perform over time and against new versions of the virus. And that requires knowing how many vaccinated people are getting so-called breakthrough infections, and when.But almost two years after the first Covid shots were administered, the C.D.C. still has no national data on breakthrough cases. A major reason is that many states and localities, citing privacy concerns, strip out names and other identifying information from much of the data they share with the C.D.C., making it impossible for the agency to figure out whether any given Covid patient was vaccinated.“The C.D.C. data is useless for actually finding out vaccine efficacy,” said Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration. Instead, regulators had to turn to reports from various regional hospital systems, knowing that picture might be skewed, and marry them with data from other countries like Israel.The jumble of studies confused even vaccine experts and sowed public doubt about the government’s booster decisions. Some experts partly blame the disappointing uptake of booster doses on squishy data.The F.D.A. now spends tens of millions of dollars annually for access to detailed Covid-related health care data from private companies, Dr. Marks said. About 30 states now also report cases and deaths by vaccination status, showing that the unvaccinated are far more likely to die of Covid than those who got shots.But those reports are incomplete, too: The state data, for instance, does not reflect prior infections, an important factor in trying to assess vaccine effectiveness.And it took years to get this far. “We started working on this in April of 2020, before we even had a vaccine authorized,” Dr. Marks said.Now, as the government rolls out reformulated booster shots ahead of a possible winter virus surge, the need for up-to-date data is as pressing as ever. The new boosters target the version of a fast-evolving virus that is currently dominant. Pharmaceutical companies are expected to deliver evidence from human clinical trials showing how well they work later this year.“But how will we know if that’s the reality on the ground?” Dr. Jha asked. Detailed clinical data that includes past infections, history of shots and brand of vaccine “is absolutely essential for policymaking,” he said.“It is going to be incredibly hard to get,” Dr. Jha added.When the first U.S. monkeypox case was confirmed on May 18, federal health officials prepared to confront another information vacuum. Federal authorities cannot generally demand public health data from states and localities, which have legal authority over that realm and zealously protect it. That has made it harder to organize a federal response to a new disease that has now spread to nearly 24,000 people nationwide.Three months into the outbreak, more than half of the people reported to have been infected were not identified by race or ethnicity, clouding the disparate impact of the disease on Black and Hispanic men.To find out how many people were being vaccinated against monkeypox, the C.D.C. was forced to negotiate data-sharing agreements with individual jurisdictions, just as it had to do for Covid. That process took until early September, even though the information was important to assess whether the taxpayer-funded doses were going to the right places.The government’s declaration in early August that the monkeypox outbreak constituted a national emergency helped ease some of the legal barriers to information sharing, health officials said. But even now, the C.D.C.’s vaccine data is based on only 38 states, plus New York City.Some critics say the C.D.C. could compensate for its lack of legal clout by exercising its financial muscle, since its grants help keep state and local health departments afloat. But others say such arm-twisting could end up harming public health if departments then decide to forgo funding and not cooperate with the agency.Nor would that address the outmoded technologies and dearth of scientists and information analysts at state and local health departments, failings that many experts say are the biggest impediment to getting timely data.Alaska is a prime example.Early in the pandemic, many of the state’s Covid case reports arrived by fax on the fifth floor of the state health department’s office in Anchorage. National Guard members had to be called in to serve as data-entry clerks.The health department’s highly trained specialists “didn’t have the capacity to be the epidemiologists that we needed them to be because all they could do was enter data,” said Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer, who also heads the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. All too often, she said, the data that was painstakingly entered was too patchy to guide decisions.A year ago, for instance, Dr. Zink asked her team whether racial and ethnic minorities were being tested less frequently than whites to assess whether testing sites were equitably located.But epidemiologists could not tell her because for 60 percent of those tested, the person’s race and ethnicity were not identified, said Megan Tompkins, a data scientist and epidemiologist who until this month managed the state’s Covid data operation.Long after mass testing sites were shuttered, Ms. Tompkins’s team was culling birth records to identify people’s race, hoping to manually update tens of thousands of old case reports in the state’s disease surveillance database. State officials still think that the racial breakdown will prove useful.“We’ve started from really broken systems,” Ms. Tompkins said. “That meant we lost a lot of the data and the ability to analyze it, produce it or do something with it.”State and local public health agencies have been shriveling, losing an estimated 15 percent of their staffs between 2008 and 2019, according to a study by the de Beaumont Foundation, a public-health-focused philanthropy. In 2019, public health accounted for 3 percent of the $3.8 trillion spent on health care in the United States.The pandemic has prompted Congress to loosen its purse strings. The C.D.C.’s $50 million annual budget for data modernization was doubled for the current fiscal year, and key senators seem optimistic it will double again next year. Two pandemic relief bills provided an additional $1 billion, including funds for a new center to analyze outbreaks.But public health funding has traced a long boom-and-bust pattern, rising during crises and shrinking once they end. Although Covid still kills about 400 Americans each day, Congress’s appetite for public health spending has waned.While $1 billion-plus for data modernization sounds impressive, it is roughly the cost of shifting a single major hospital system to electronic health records, Dr. Walensky said.For the first two years of the pandemic, the C.D.C.’s disease surveillance database was supposed to track not just every confirmed Covid infection, but whether infected individuals were symptomatic, had recently traveled or attended a mass gathering, had underlying medical conditions, had been hospitalized, had required intensive care and had survived. State and local health departments reported data on 86 million cases.But a vast majority of data fields are usually left blank, an analysis by The New York Times found. Even race and ethnicity, factors essential to understanding the pandemic’s unequal impact, are missing in about one-third of the cases. Only the patient’s sex, age group and geographic location are routinely recorded.While the C.D.C. says the basic demographic data remains broadly useful, swamped health departments were too overwhelmed or too ill-equipped to provide more. In February, the agency recommended that they stop trying and focus on high-risk groups and settings instead.The C.D.C. has patched together other, disparate sources of data, each imperfect in its own way. A second database tracks how many Covid patients turn up in about 70 percent of the nation’s emergency departments and urgent care centers. It is an early warning signal of rising infections. But it is spotty: Many departments in California, Minnesota, Oklahoma and elsewhere do not participate.Another database tracks how many hospital inpatients have Covid. It, too, is not comprehensive, and it is arguably inflated because totals include patients admitted for reasons other than Covid, but who tested positive during their stay. The C.D.C. nevertheless relies partly on those hospital numbers for its rolling, county-by-county assessment of the virus’s threat. There are bright spots. Wastewater monitoring, a new tool that helps spot incipient coronavirus surges, is now conducted at 1,182 sites around the country. The government now tests enough viral specimens to detect whether a new version of the virus has begun to circulate.In the long run, officials hope to leverage electronic health records to modernize the disease surveillance system that all but collapsed under the weight of the pandemic. Under the new system, if a doctor diagnoses a disease that is supposed to be flagged to public health authorities, the patient’s electronic health record would automatically generate a case report to local or state health departments.Hospitals and clinicians are under pressure to deliver: The federal government is requiring them to show progress toward automated case reports by year’s end or face possible financial penalties. So far, though, only 15 percent of the nearly 5,300 hospitals certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are actually generating electronic case reports.And many experts say automated case reports from the private sector are only half the solution. Unless public health departments also modernize their data operations, they will be unable to process the reports that hospitals and providers will be required to send them.“People often say, ‘That’s great, you put the pitchers on steroids, but you didn’t give the catchers a mask or a good mitt,’” said Micky Tripathi, the national coordinator for health information technology at the Department of Health and Human Services.The effort to document the Fairbanks woman’s Covid case shows just how far many health departments have yet to go. After the woman was tested, her workplace transferred her nasal swab to the Fairbanks state laboratory. There, workers manually entered basic information into an electronic lab report, searching a state database for the woman’s address and telephone number.The state lab then forwarded her case report to the state health department’s epidemiology section, where the same information had to be retyped into a database that feeds the C.D.C.’s national disease surveillance database. A worker logged in and clicked through multiple screens in yet another state database to learn that the woman had not been vaccinated, then manually updated her file.The epidemiology section then added the woman’s case to a spreadsheet with more than 1,500 others recorded that day. That was forwarded to a different team of contact tracers, who gathered other important details about the woman by telephone, then plugged those details into yet another database.The result was a rich stew of information, but because the contact tracers’ database is incompatible with the epidemiologists’ database, their information could not be easily shared at either the state or the federal level.For example, when the contact tracers learned a few days later that the woman had been hospitalized with Covid, they had to inform the epidemiology section by email, and the epidemiologists got the hospital’s confirmation by fax.Ms. Tompkins said Alaska’s problem was not so much that it was short of information, but that it was unable to meld the data it had into usable form. Alaska’s health officials reached the same conclusion as many of their state and federal counterparts: The disease surveillance system “did not work,” Ms. Tompkins said, “and we need to start rethinking it from the ground up.”The C.D.C. awarded Alaska a $3.3 million grant for data modernization last year. State officials considered that a start, but anticipated much more when a second five-year public health grant for personnel and infrastructure was awarded this summer.They hoped not only to improve their digital systems, but to beef up their tiny work force, including by hiring a data modernization director.Carrie Paykoc, the health department’s data coordinator, texted Dr. Zink at 8 p.m. on June 22, after news of the grant arrived.The award was $1.8 million a year, including just $213,000 for data modernization. “Pretty dire,” she wrote.“We were hoping for moonshot funding,” Ms. Paykoc said. “We learned it was a nice camper van.”Kitty Bennett contributed research.</body>

	<title>Your Tuesday Briefing</title>
	<author>Natasha Frost</author>
	<body>Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest yesterday after a majestic state funeral that drew millions of viewers across the country and was accessible to billions around the world. It was the culmination of 10 days of mourning since the queen’s death on Sept. 8 in Scotland — a highly choreographed series of rituals that came amid a deepening economic crisis and a fraught political transition in Britain.More than 100 world leaders, including President Biden and Emperor Naruhito of Japan, converged on London, the largest such gathering since the funeral of Nelson Mandela in 2013 in South Africa. Tens of thousands of people lined the cortege’s route past the city’s landmarks.The service was designed to showcase Britain’s imperial history, its constitutional democracy and its Commonwealth. The carriage that bore the queen’s coffin was the same one used during Queen Victoria’s funeral in 1901. Both Britain’s new prime minister, Liz Truss, and the secretary general of the Commonwealth, Patricia Scotland, read from the Bible.Context: Britain will now return to wrestling with the gravest economic crisis in a generation. Fears about the country’s public finances have driven the pound to its lowest levels against the dollar since 1985. The survival of the monarchy’s far-flung realm is in question, as Caribbean countries debate whether to cast off the king as their head of state.Photos: See images from Elizabeth’s life and a visual dictionary of the symbols of her reign.Reflection: The queen’s coronation and her funeral have become the bookends of a generation, Alan Cowell, a contributor based in London, writes in an essay.A Russian missile exploded less than 900 feet from the reactors of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, Ukrainian officials said. Unlike the Zaporizhzhia plant, which sits in an active battlefield, the South Ukraine site is far from the frontline fighting, illustrating Russia’s long reach.Security camera footage showed a huge fireball lighting up the night sky over the site, and the shock wave blew out more than 100 windows at the South Ukraine complex, Ukraine’s second-biggest nuclear plant. There was no damage to essential safety equipment there, Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company said.The source of the explosion could not be independently confirmed, but the strike fit Russia’s long-established pattern of attacking critical Ukrainian infrastructure, even when such assaults pose a serious threat to civilians. Russia has battered the energy systems that Ukrainian civilians rely on with artillery and occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant for months.Other updates:Senior officials from China and Russia announced joint military exercises and enhanced defense cooperation, signaling a strengthening partnership despite Beijing’s apparent misgivings about the war in Ukraine.Ukraine is facing a severe glass shortage that will make it hard to fix shattered windows before winter.European manufacturers are furloughing workers and shutting down lines because of “crippling” energy bills.The 77th session of the U.N. General Assembly, the largest annual gathering of world leaders, began yesterday in New York City. Here’s what to expect this week.The meeting is the first in-person session in three years, after more than two years of pandemic disruptions. But the mood is likely to be a somber one. Leaders will address the war in Ukraine, mounting food and energy crises and concerns over climate disruptions, such as the floods in Pakistan.Tensions are expected to be high between Russia, the U.S. and European countries over the war in Ukraine — and between China and the U.S. over Taiwan and trade. Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, the leaders of Russia and China, are not expected to attend. “The General Assembly is meeting at a time of great peril,” António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, said last week.Analysis: “This is the first General Assembly of a fundamentally divided world,” said Richard Gowan, the U.N. director at International Crisis Group, a research group based in Brussels. “We have spent six months with everyone battering each other. The gloves are off.”In a prisoner swap with the U.S., the Taliban freed an American engineer in exchange for the release a tribal leader convicted of drug trafficking, above.Hurricane Fiona deluged Puerto Rico with rain and flash floods. Five years after Hurricane Maria, the island is once again in the dark.A bus carrying people to a Covid quarantine center crashed in southwestern China, killing at least 27.A magnitude 7.6 earthquake, centered near the boundary of the Mexican states of Colima and Michoacan, killed at least one person.A judge overturned the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, whose case was at the center of the first season of the podcast “Serial.”White House officials told the U.S. military that they were concerned about its efforts to spread pro-American messaging on social media.A former White House lawyer warned Donald Trump late last year that he could face legal liability if he did not return government materials he had taken with him when he left office.In 2017, as American feminists came together to protest Donald Trump’s election, Russia’s disinformation machine worked to derail the Women’s March, a Times investigation found.New York City is considering housing asylum seekers on cruise ships.A small Australian spider uses an acrobatic tactic to prey on fierce ants.Thirty-four years ago, a group of men helped save the writer A.J. Jacobs and his sister after a kayaking mishap on a cold, dark night in Alaska. These days, he writes, he tells his sons the story to remind them that, “despite much evidence to the contrary, humans have the capacity to be amazingly kind.”Bruno Fernandes exclusive: The Manchester United star explains how Erik ten Hag is changing things at Old Trafford. He talks Rangnick, Ronaldo — and that “Encanto” song, in a wide-ranging interview.Todd Boehly’s multiclub plan: Chelsea’s new U.S. owner has not been involved in soccer long, but these are the clubs he could buy in Portugal, Belgium and Brazil.From Las Vegas to Bournemouth: Bill Foley, the majority owner of the N.H.L. franchise the Golden Knights, is poised to branch out into soccer. He has his sights set on a Premier League club — why?How does a group of people achieve a consensus? And what happens to their brains after such discussions? A new study, recently published online but not yet peer-reviewed, showed that a robust conversation resulting in consensus synchronizes the talkers’ brains — and not only when thinking about the topic that was discussed.The study focused on participants’ responses to critically acclaimed movies. But there’s evidence that a similar approach — a respectful, engaged conversation — can make a difference to people’s points of view in politics, too.Political scientists have long argued for the value of discussion. Put a diverse group of people in a room, they say, and they’re likely to mute their harshest views and wrestle more deeply with rebuttals. They become more informed, even more empathetic.In 2019, 526 voters from across the U.S. came together for a weekend at a resort outside Dallas, where they were asked to share their opinions on hot-button issues like immigration or health care. Though many said they had not changed their minds, pre- and post-conference surveys suggested that people on both the left and the right appeared to edge toward the center.Garam masala punches up this vegetarian pantry pasta.Gen Z’s jeans are unzipped and unbuttoned.Three siblings reunite in Amanda Svensson’s turbulent novel “A System So Magnificent It Is Blinding.”Here’s today’s Mini Crossword, and a clue: “Well, golly!” (three letters).And here are today’s Wordle and the Spelling Bee.You can find all our puzzles here.That’s it for today’s briefing.

	<title>Advocacy Groups Are Helping Drive a Rise in Book Bans</title>
	<author>Elizabeth A. Harris</author>
	<body>At least 50 advocacy groups pushed to ban books during the last school year, according to a report that the free speech group PEN America released on Monday, highlighting how challenges to reading material have become a political issue across the country.“This is a concerted, organized, well-resourced push at censorship,” said Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive of PEN America. The effort, she said, “is ideologically motivated and politically expedient, and it needs to be understood as such in order to be confronted and addressed properly.”Traditionally, when individual parents had concerns about books their children were reading, they would approach a teacher or librarian directly to discuss it. But today, long lists of titles deemed objectionable circulate online, bouncing from one district to the next. Elected officials, including local office holders and governors, have staked out vocal positions on the issue, demanding that “obscene” materials and even specific titles be rooted out from school libraries. Restrictions have also come in the form of district-level policy changes and statewide legislation, the report said.“There needs to be room for discussion of things like age appropriateness and readiness, that’s perfectly legitimate,” Nossel said. “But that’s not what this is about.”Of the groups that have pushed to have certain books removed from schools, PEN said, Moms for Liberty has grown the fastest. Formed in 2021, it now lists more than 200 local chapters on its website, according to the report.Those who have pushed to restrict access to reading material say it should be up to parents to decide what books their children can access, and that they are trying to protect children from content they are not ready to confront.PEN found that more than 1,600 book titles were banned from schools the United States from July of 2021 to June of 2022 — it defined a “ban” as the removal of a book or a restriction of access to it. The state with the most bans was Texas, the organization said, followed by Florida and then Pennsylvania.Across the country, PEN said, restrictions occurred in 138 school districts, which included 5,000 individual schools and enrolled nearly 4 million students.</body>

	<title>Robert Fripp Lightens Up</title>
	<author>Jon Pareles</author>
	<body>Robert Fripp became a rock star without acting like a showman. As the guitarist and leader of King Crimson — the band he founded in 1969 — Fripp, 76, has written music that’s barbed, visceral, complex and ambitious, seizing the vanguard of progressive rock yet reaching a broad audience.King Crimson’s catalog has found multiple generations of admirers among musicians, including the Rolling Stones, the Clash, the Mars Volta, Black Midi and even Kanye West, who sampled “21st Century Schizoid Man” in the song “Power,” which has been streamed more than 135 million times. (The deal involved is still under litigation.)Fripp’s guitar riffs are saw-toothed and dissonant; his solos lines slice and sear. But onstage, he has always been the picture of an introvert: seated, taciturn, entirely concentrating on his guitar.“Some players can put on a really great show playing guitar. I can’t,” Fripp said in a rare video interview from Long Island, where he was preparing to teach one of his Guitar Craft seminars. His white shirt, vest and tightly knotted tie were a sartorial contrast with his hair: a gray, upright Mohawk. “I have to focus and pay attention very closely. I have no room for jumping around or symbolic gestures. So the excitement isn’t in what the player is doing in terms of his gestures. It’s in terms of the music which is appearing.”But during the pandemic, Fripp has showed a new public face: droll, chatty and unpretentious. He and his manager, David Singleton, are on a speaking tour called “That Awful Man and His Manager,” promising to discuss music and business and to answer fan questions; it comes to City Winery in Manhattan on Friday. (The “awful man” designation teases at Fripp’s many disgruntled former bandmates and business associates.)Spurred by his wife, the pop-rock singer Toyah Willcox, in 2020 Fripp started co-starring in a charmingly homemade weekly series of YouTube videos, “Toyah and Robert’s Sunday Lunch,” that has them attacking pop and rock hits from Metallica’s “Enter Sandman” to Britney Spears’s “Toxic,” often in costumes and makeup. The couple has also danced — both in tutus — to “Swan Lake.”Outside of King Crimson, Fripp has made ambient music using Brian Eno’s “Frippertronics” looping setup; added indelible solos to songs like David Bowie’s “Heroes”; produced albums for Peter Gabriel, the Roches and Daryl Hall; written voluminously in an ongoing online diary; and taught Guitar Craft seminars, where he seeks to instill the same technical and philosophical discipline — an important word for Fripp — that he brings to his own playing.He has repeatedly dissolved and reconfigured King Crimson to his shifting but exacting specifications. “When there is nothing to be done, nothing is done: Crimson disappears,” Fripp has said. “When there is music to be played, Crimson reappears. If all of life were this simple.”A documentary, “In the Court of the Crimson King,” appeared at festivals earlier this year, and Fripp completed a book, “The Guitar Circle,” with the lessons of his Guitar Craft seminars. He is about to release a collection of his long-accruing aphorisms about music, ethics and creativity in three sets of 78 cards each, the same number as a Tarot deck. Leaving no merchandising opportunity unturned, he also offers personalized, handwritten, metal-leafed versions of his aphorisms.A chat with Fripp invariably spirals outward, from the particulars of guitar tunings to what he jovially calls, with an expletive, “cosmic” horse manure. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What makes a man go on tour with his manager?Probably to present our work to the world in a way that doesn’t quite get across in social media, in the same way that performance, for me, is really the only place where you connect with music. When you meet someone face to face, you can engage. And a key part of the so-called speaking tour is likely to be the Q&amp;A.During the pandemic you became very active on social media. Did YouTube change your life?Yes, very much indeed. The main change in my life, following lockdown, is I got to spend time with my wife for the first time in 34 years of marriage up to that point. And I loved it. I have a wonderful, dear wife, but I kept leaving her. For me, lockdown was an opportunity to address some subjects of interest to me, including catching up on my academic reading in music. But there is my dear wife thinking, “This old character is losing it — I’ve got to get him going.” So then out came the tutu and “Swan Lake,” which was something of a turning point in my life.You’ve been more performative on YouTube than you have been for 40 years in King Crimson.I think that’s probably true.Is that going to change you when you go back to performing concerts?I don’t think I can look back. I think the future has now shot off on an entirely different trajectory. A personal interest for me is kicking received opinion. Because if you were only seen in a certain way, there is a richness in life which is somehow closed to you. A question: Have you seen Toyah and Robert live sitting in with the Trevor Horn band at the Cropready festival?Yes, you played Lenny Kravitz and tuned your guitar in the standard tuning, E-A-D-G-B-E, for the first time since 1984. You broke your streak. But most of your lockdown songs were probably written in standard tuning.That’s right. I’m learning to play in E again. And after spending nearly two years working very hard, translating classic rock riffs into a C pentatonic tuning — that’s C-G-D-A-E-G — to actually tune to E is a lot easier, but it’s also a challenge.How did the C tuning start?I was in the Apple Health Spa on Bleecker and Thompson back in September 1983, in the sauna at half past 10 in the morning, almost asleep, and the tuning flew over my head. At the time I couldn’t understand what it was for. I was asked to give a guitar seminar at Claymont Court in December 1994, to raise funds for the running of the estate and the children’s school. There was a click and I realized the tuning was for the guitar class. So at that point, anyone who came into a Guitar Craft seminar was pretty much on the same page. Whether you had experience or not, you have a new tuning. Including me.Which has now led to the book, “The Guitar Circle.”It’s pretty much what, as a young guitarist, I would have liked to have known. The aphorisms are probably the most useful part of the book.What unanswered questions do you still have?I know pretty much all I need to know at this point in my life. But it’s a question of engaging with it. And I hesitate because it’s so easy to get involved in cosmic horse [expletive]. An understanding is what you can take onstage that’s entirely practical.Speaking of the stage, the most recent version of King Crimson turned the typical setup inside out, putting the drums up front and the other musicians in the back. Why did you do that?It’s a very simple story. I think maybe it was July 2013 — Toyah and I were visiting chums in Vauxhall. I was sipping gently on prosecco, and for some reason I asked the question, “If King Crimson were to perform tomorrow night, what would it be?” And then it appeared: three drummers at the front, the conventional front line at the back. It was what we call the point of seeing, and I trust points of seeing in that way. And then I knew what King Crimson would be if it formed.But I wasn’t sure that I wanted to take that up because King Crimson for me is grief. Nothing else in my life can happen when King Crimson is in go mode. It is such a responsibility. The background to King Crimson is in the counterculture. And we probably wouldn’t use the term today, but the aim was to change the world. Can music change the world? Well, back then, all the young players and probably most in the audience would say, “Of course it can.” But moving 53 years later, we’d say, Well, that’s horse [expletive]. But for me it’s not. It’s still an ongoing concern and a responsibility to the originating intention within King Crimson, which is something that is always possible when music is available. That is a continuing theme and a continuing imperative.Isn’t there some pleasure in performing?During the rehearsals, as we were playing the notes, I felt the music move into the notes. There is a quite distinct experience of King Crimson as an individuality in this thing, entirely apart from whoever is playing it, moving into this certain place onstage. And for me, that is validation. But if, for whatever reason, a performance doesn’t meet what is possible, it is an acute suffering for me.People can recognize your guitar tone from a single note. What do you want that tone to be?True. That’s all.The actual sound of the note may change, like if you’re sustaining or whatever. But that’s the criterion. Is this note true? And I remember with King Crimson, I think it was in Preston — it might have been Derby — in the autumn of 1972. And I threw off a lick. And it was awful. It felt like I was lying to my mother. It violated conscience for that one lick. I was lying to music and that was appalling. And it still irks me to this day.What have you learned from all the pop songs you’ve been playing on YouTube? When I heard “Toxic,” that sounded like a Crimson riff.Some of the riffs, I think, “Hmm, maybe we supped at the same table.” I love playing classic rock riffs. They are relatively easy, providing you’re alert when you’re playing them. It was a privilege playing in Crimson, but it was a very specific repertoire. As a guitar player, it’s like the Olympics of guitar, phenomenally difficult lines, and it required two to four hours of practicing a day. Now, King Crimson is not in go mode. I can step back from it to a certain extent and move my attention into learning E tuning.You’re touring with your manager, and you have an aphorisms deck called Finance. How does having to earn a living affect your music?I have no problem singing for my supper. My sense has always been: Present your work to the public. Some people change their work to meet what they believe their public is. Well, that might work for a while, but I have no idea what my public will want, so if I hear something, I follow it. If I see something, I follow it and present it to the public, trusting that there will be a sufficiency in order for a supper to arrive. And historically that’s worked. Some times have been better than the others, but riches and popularity have never been on the top of my to-do list.I’ve learned to trust the music, trust the process. And it’s important that the audience should know they are as important as the musician. If the audience is present and engaged and listening, the relationship is qualitatively different. When that happens, the moment becomes actually real. And there is a profound satisfaction in there. And then you go back, you get on the bus and you drive overnight to the next venue and it all begins again.</body>

	<title>Bus Taking People to Quarantine Crashes in China, Killing 27</title>
	<author>Joy Dong</author>
	<body>BEIJING — A bus that was carrying dozens of people to a quarantine facility crashed over the weekend in southwestern China, killing at least 27 of them and setting off a renewed, anguished debate about the country’s zero-tolerance Covid policies.The bus was transporting 47 people from the city of Guiyang when it rolled over around 2:40 a.m. on Sunday, about 100 miles southeast of the city, according to the local authorities. In addition to the 27 people killed, the 20 other people onboard were injured.Much of Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, has been under lockdown since earlier this month, after several hundred coronavirus infections were detected there. Under China’s “zero Covid” policies, just a handful of cases is enough to trigger mass quarantines and testing — an approach that has increasingly worn on many Chinese, as the rest of the world moves toward living with the virus.On Saturday, the day before the crash, the Guiyang authorities said that they were sending people to other cities to be quarantined, because there were too many of them for the facilities in Guiyang to accommodate. After the crash, officials did not say why the people on the bus were being quarantined, such as whether they had tested positive for the virus or were contacts of people who had; they said only that the passengers were “epidemic-related.”As news of the crash emerged, Chinese social media erupted with fierce debate about whether the country’s Covid policies were to blame. Users asked whether the passengers had needed to be transferred at all and why the bus had been on the road so late at night, when Chinese traffic laws prohibit most long-distance passenger vehicles from driving between 2 and 5 a.m. Some said that such a tragedy could have happened to anyone, given the government’s fixation on eliminating cases and ordinary people’s powerlessness to resist it. And many raised a question that has become a familiar one in China, as lockdowns across the country have led to food and medical shortages, separation of parents from children and mental health crises: Was there any price for “zero Covid” that the government would consider too high? (Guizhou Province has recorded only two deaths from the coronavirus since the pandemic began.)Nie Riming, a researcher at the Shanghai Institute of Finance and Law, wrote in a widely shared online article that the crash was “not an isolated incident.”“Many cities, while controlling outbreaks, have violated laws and regulations numerous times,” Mr. Nie wrote. “The only difference is that accidents have not yet occurred in other cities.”Censors removed many angry comments about the crash, as well as the entire accounts of some users who had shared their outrage or grief. In a reflection of how polarizing and politicized the Covid debate in China has become, some social media users struck back at the critics, saying that people who would turn a traffic accident into a political debate must be servants of Western forces.The Chinese authorities have long been wary of large outpourings of public grief, which have often involved cries for accountability and shaken people’s trust in the government. But officials are on particularly high alert now, with a major Chinese Communist Party congress due next month, at which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to claim an unprecedented third term.Local governments have been under intense pressure to contain any outbreaks before that meeting, given Mr. Xi’s personal emphasis on the importance of “zero Covid.” Guizhou had pledged to essentially eliminate cases by Monday.At a news conference on Sunday night, Guiyang’s deputy mayor said officials were “incomparably remorseful” about the crash and “sincerely apologized to the entire society.” The authorities in Guizhou Province promised an investigation, and three local officials were suspended on Monday. But officials have not given a reason for the crash or whether any traffic laws were violated.Many social media users dismissed the apology as hollow. “Can an apology replace the law?” He Guangwei, a well-known journalist, wrote on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform.Guizhou’s lockdown had been riddled by problems even before the crash. The government was forced to apologize on Sept. 8, shortly after the city shut down, after many residents reported food shortages. Officials said Covid restrictions had caused a shortage of delivery workers.Residents had also complained of unsanitary or shoddy conditions at quarantine facilities, leading the local government to acknowledge that conditions were “uneven.” The Chinese authorities have refused to allow home quarantine.Late last week, the city’s Communist Party secretary, Hu Zhongxiong, called for residents to be sent to quarantine more quickly, urging same-day transfers. By Saturday afternoon, more than 7,000 people had been sent out of Guiyang, with nearly 3,000 more in the process of being transferred, officials said.Hours later, at 10 minutes after midnight, the bus departed from Guiyang.Vivian Wang reported from Beijing and Joy Dong from Hong Kong.

	<title>Dinner in Seven Ingredients (or Even Fewer!)</title>
	<author>Krysten Chambrot</author>
	<body>You don’t need a ton of ingredients for a meal that sings.The recipes featured here are marvels of resourcefulness, offering enormous flavor in little time and with seven ingredients or fewer (minus those kitchen stalwarts salt, pepper and oil).We draw the line at seven rather than five or even three (like those buzzy headlines promise) because we believe that the best meals reach just a tiny bit further. An ingredient or two more — a smattering of scallions, a dash of sweet-salty miso, the juice from a single orange — really can be the difference between a good dinner and a great one.Easy and cheap doesn’t mean skimping on excitement or flavor, and proving that is our goal. After all, the most streamlined meals are often the most ingenious — and the most treasured.You can feel like you’ve gone on a trip to Italy without even leaving the house. This Kay Chun recipe is a textbook example of how a few humble ingredients can create big, comforting, complex flavors. Treat yourself to a little guanciale, and opt for the irresistible bite of bucatini. Or don’t! And stick with pancetta and regular spaghetti. Either way, enjoy it al fresco with a glass of wine in hand.Recipe: Pasta AmatricianaDried mint and ground turmeric flavor this easy chicken whose light spices recall Morocco. Nargisse Benkabbou employs a single orange to do double duty, its zest and juice infusing the marinade. Reach for chicken thighs or breasts, whichever you prefer, as long as they’re boneless and skinless — just be sure to sear over high heat with a close eye so that the meat stays tender. Or do as our commenters have and fire it up over the grill.Recipe: Skillet Chicken With Turmeric and OrangeThis recipe, from the Philadelphia restaurateurs Michael Solomonov and Steven Cook, is as clever as they come, simplifying a much longer process into a speedy five-minute affair that happens entirely in a food processor. But arguably better than its speed and short ingredient list is its adaptability. Eat it the first day with warm flatbread, then use it as a vehicle for leftovers, piling the hummus high with roasted vegetables or a bit of ground meat, warmly spiced.Recipe: 5-Minute HummusHeatseekers, have you met Ali Slagle’s kimchi grilled cheese? She calls for mozzarella, which gives kimchi’s gorgeous tang the space to stand out, but feel free to add a little Cheddar or those Jack cousins (Monterrey and pepper) to intensify the sandwich’s flavor. This recipe also taps into a smart, beloved technique: spreading mayonnaise on the outside of the bread before toasting. The oil base means the mayo doesn’t run the risk of burning in the same way that the milk solids in butter do, so the bread can turn crisp and golden in due time.Recipe: Kimchi Grilled CheesePernil is a perfect dish. A special occasion recipe for many in Puerto Rico and the diaspora, it’s often served at Thanksgiving or Christmas when you want to impress, or to just let someone know you love them. Pork shoulder, an affordable cut of meat, is treated to a (relatively) long marinade and cook time for a feast that feeds long after, with leftovers that shine nestled next to rice and black beans, or in between crisp-soft bread. Von Diaz adapted this recipe, which yields burnished chicharrón and tender meat, from Maricel Presilla’s “Gran Cocina Latina,” a meticulously researched tome of Latin American cuisine. As Von wrote, “It’s blessed by her brilliance.”Recipe: PernilSharp bites of scallions complement earthy grilled steak that’s been marinated in a deeply savory combination of soy, mirin, sake and sugar in this traditional Japanese dish. Normally an appetizer, it needs only steamed rice or the bite and char of roasted broccoli to become a full meal. For an even faster path to this Kay Chun recipe, take a cue from the comments section and use thinly sliced beef meant for hot pot, often sold at Korean markets.Recipe: Beef NegimakiJudy Kim has graced us with this fantastic recipe for slick, spicy noodles, finished with a fresh smattering of herbs. Best of all, it takes well to substitutions and adaptations: Can’t find garlic chives? Use scallions instead. The same goes for chile crisp and chile oil. Add some fried shallots, if you don’t mind taking this recipe into eight-ingredient territory. It’s ready in 20 minutes, but wise cooks know to take just an extra minute to double or triple the sauce for future meals.Recipe: Chile Oil Noodles With CilantroStrip kale leaves from their stems, then soak them in a bath of boiling water. Throw them into a blender with some olive oil and grated cheese until they’re thoroughly puréed, and toss them with whatever pasta you have. (A mix of odds and ends? Sure!) That’s all it takes for a dinner that’s equal parts rich and light in this recipe, adapted by Tejal Rao from Joshua McFadden, the chef at Ava Gene’s in Portland, Ore., who was inspired by Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers of the River Cafe in London.Recipe: Kale Sauce PastaDinner in 15 minutes and just five ingredients, this Yasmin Fahr recipe is as generous as it is tart and creamy. Use labneh or a thick yogurt and any number of short pasta shapes. Make it as written, or go bigger — from five ingredients to six (wow) — and make the lemony scallion topping mentioned in the Tip. The details are up to you, but this pasta will be good no matter what.Recipe: Creamy, Lemony PastaAdapted from his cookbook “The Wok: Recipes and Techniques,” J. Kenji López-Alt based this recipe on a brilliant dish created and served by Helene An at Thanh Long in San Francisco. His iteration uses dried Italian spaghetti, rather than the fresh wheat noodles of the original, but the tastes still recall Ms. An’s dish. Twenty garlic cloves may seem like a lot (and it is), but they infuse these noodles with a welcome intensity. Pair them with seafood or spinach, or do as Kenji recommends and finish with a little bit of tarako or mentaiko, Japanese salted pollock roe.Recipe: San Francisco-Style Vietnamese American Garlic NoodlesFor this fragrant vegetarian curry, Ali Slagle borrows a technique from the cookbook author Andrea Nguyen, who first warms tofu with some of the sauce (for flavor) before adding the frying oil (for crunch). Once crisp, it’s pulled from the pan, which is then used to quickly sear whatever vegetable you’d like. Add and reduce a coconut milk-infused sauce before serving it all over rice or whatever grain most stirs your heart.Recipe: Green Curry Glazed TofuEvery Kwanzaa, Folami Prescott-Adams, a community psychologist in Atlanta and an expert holiday host, makes 10 pounds of this recipe for the karamu, the culminating feast. Adapted by Nicole Taylor, it’s a comforting and sustaining recipe whose simple brilliance extends beyond the celebration. True to its roots as a buffet dish, it can easily be scaled up, and you may want to do just that, even if you’re not feeding a crowd.Recipe: Folami’s BBQ TofuWhat if you could have a classic Parm without the fuss? Hetty McKinnon pairs that fan-favorite combination of red sauce and melty mozzarella with earthy portobello mushrooms for a meal that comes together easily and delivers so much satisfaction. It’s finished with a smattering of basil-scented bread crumbs for a mix of textures you simply won’t forget.Recipe: Sheet-Pan Mushroom ParmesanIf you have some slightly sweet vegetables at your disposal — not just carrots, but onions, parsnips, beets or pumpkin — this is the recipe for you. Sue Li lays them on a bed of creamy ricotta and briny feta supported by flaky puff pastry. The one big tip: Don’t forget to cook your veggies first. Raw vegetables release liquid that can weigh down your otherwise crisp-crunchy puff pastry and take away from its charm.Recipe: Carrot Tart With Ricotta and FetaSalty, sour and sweet flavors define chicken adobo, the national dish of the Philippines, and here, Ali Slagle applies that same flavor profile to cauliflower for a vegetarian spin. Brown sugar adds sweetness, Thai chile a little heat and bay leaves a subtle herbaceousness. Serve it all over rice with a heaping spoonful of that deeply savory sauce and green vegetables.Recipe: Cauliflower AdoboThere’s great beauty in Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor’s one-step recipe. It’s intentionally simple, with few ingredients and lean direction, echoing Ms. Smart-Grosvenor’s approach in the kitchen. “I just do it by vibration,” she wrote in her 1970 cookbook “Vibration Cooking, or the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl.” Cook until the blind-baked crust is golden brown and the custard is just set; add ham or cheese or herbs before cooking; or chill it and then dig in the next day when the custard is especially creamy. As Ms. Smart-Grosvenor writes: “Do your thing your way.”Recipe: Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor’s Onion PieYewande Komolafe incorporates a few shelf-stable ingredients — canned pumpkin purée, coconut milk, peanut butter — in this simple soup adapted from a long-simmered West African stew. Her version is ready in 35 easy minutes, and the optional additions are just that — optional. But if you find yourself with a bit of honey to mix in or yogurt to dollop on top, you’ll have an even more nuanced dish, lightly sweet with heat that doesn’t overstay its welcome.Recipe: Spicy Peanut and Pumpkin SoupAny kind of spicy fresh sausage is right at home in this easy one-pot stew from Melissa Clark. Chorizo, kielbasa or even sweet sausage with a hearty pinch of hot paprika would all work, as long as there’s some heat. Sautéed, then simmered, cilantro stems infuse the soup with their earthy flavor. You really don’t need to finish with scallions, avocado or lime wedges, but they’re nice alongside, as are tortilla chips.Recipe: Black Bean Chorizo StewThis roast chicken, from the chef Judy Rodgers of Zuni Café in San Francisco, proves that you don’t need much to make an excellent dinner. The key here is in the technique: Dry-brining the chicken, then roasting it in a hot oven (with a quick flip to ensure even browning) means crisp skin, tender meat and flavorful drippings that reduce into a comforting, savory sauce. Greens and a baguette turn a main into a full meal.Recipe: Zuni Café ChickenEric Kim cooks skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs in a hot, hot oven until you can hear them sizzling, a great sign that their skins are crispy and their fat has rendered. As if that weren’t mouthwatering enough, he then tosses hand-torn chunks of bread onto the pan. (Why hand-torn? Every little imperfect nook is a home for that glorious schmaltz.) A quick fish-sauce butter, assembled on the stove, is spooned over top. A bed of greens would be a great accompaniment, but if you just wanted to sop up the buttery sauce with those croutons, we wouldn’t blame you.Recipe: Roasted Chicken With Fish Sauce ButterGinger, mint, lime, shrimp, some oil and salt: With those ingredients and this Ali Slagle recipe, you’ll achieve the platonic ideal of shrimp, charred and lively with a sweet snap. Central to it all is a thoughtful approach to grilling. Very dry shrimp goes on a very dry grill, preferably with their tails on to keep them from wiggling out of your fingers and into the pit of the grill. Marinate the shrimp if you’d like more of that flavor to shine through, but you’ll be just fine without.Recipe: Ginger Mint Grilled ShrimpEric Kim blooms gochugaru, a Korean red-pepper powder, in maple syrup, vinegar and butter to create a stunning ruby-red glaze for salmon. But he doesn’t stop there. He harnesses the salmon fat and uses it to toast leftover rice, which becomes crackling and golden brown on the outside and warm and chewy on the inside. With all those textures, add one more: a big, juicy crunch, preferably from cucumbers, pickles or a big salad built on leafy romaine.Recipe: Gochugaru Salmon With Crispy RiceWhite fish is no stranger to an infusion of lemon and capers. But in this recipe from Danielle Alvarez’s cookbook “Always Add Lemon,” and adapted by Melissa Clark, nori sheets are blended into a briny oil that’s brushed onto the fillets. (Double it for future use. Trust us.) It’s a brilliant way to make seaweed snacks a dinner star, adding depth that makes a reliably good meal great.Recipe: Roasted Lemony Fish With Brown Butter, Capers and NoriRanch has many uses — chip flavoring, salad dressing, dip — but its smartest application yet may come by way of Ali Slagle, who pairs it with chicken, both as a sauce and marinade. Rather than using store-bought ranch, she builds her own around Greek yogurt and mayonnaise, which tenderizes the meat while giving it a burnished exterior. And true to ranch’s versatile nature, this same marinade can be slathered on fish, pork, shrimp or any sturdy vegetable. Ranch carrots, here we come.Recipe: Pan-Seared Ranch ChickenProduced by Krysten Chambrot, Kim Gougenheim, Rebecca Halleck, Nikita Richardson and Tanya Sichynsky.

	<title>The Redistricting Mess Comes to New York’s City Council</title>
	<author>Jeffery C. Mays</author>
	<body>For several long months, New York’s efforts to redraw state congressional maps were caught in a fractious, litigious battle, ultimately leading to ugly intraparty fights and the ouster of incumbent House members.Now it is New York City’s turn, and the early returns suggest that its attempt to remake the boundaries of its 51 City Council districts will also face a rocky road.The redistricting commission, whose members are appointed by the mayor and leaders of the City Council, submitted a preliminary map in July that envisioned sweeping changes across the city.The map immediately drew criticism from all quarters for breaking up communities of interest and not protecting minority communities covered by the Voting Rights Act — just like its congressional counterpart.Among the proposals were splitting Rochdale Village in Queens, home to one of the largest groups of Black co-op owners in the city, into two districts. In Manhattan, Hell’s Kitchen was divided among three districts; in Brooklyn, two neighborhoods rich with Latino voters, Sunset Park and Red Hook, would have been placed in separate districts.But perhaps the most eyebrow-raising move involved relocating parts of Manhattan’s East Side, including some of Sutton Place and portions of Hunter College, to districts in Queens.The college’s so-called Seventh Floor Bridge spanning Lexington Avenue would have been divided between two Manhattan districts, and the site of the new nursing school and science building would have been part of a district that encompassed Queens and Manhattan.“We love our iconic bridge spanning Lexington Avenue, but frankly, turning it into a bridge between Council districts is simply a bridge too far,” Jennifer J. Raab, the president of Hunter College, said at a commission hearing in Manhattan.On Thursday, the commission — which received a record-breaking 9,500 written and verbal comments after a series of public hearings — will release a new iteration of its map, and a version examined by The New York Times shows that many of the most disputed changes have been reversed.“There were some things that we just had to change,” said Dennis Walcott, the chairman of the redistricting commission and chief executive of the Queens Library.Those changes include keeping Hunter College and Sutton Place in a Manhattan district.“How could we do that,” Mr. Walcott said about splitting the college, adding an expletive for emphasis. As a veteran public official who has served as deputy mayor and schools chancellor, Mr. Walcott said he still harbored few illusions that the commission’s revised maps will please everyone, “because you can’t please everyone.”Take for example the pressure for the maps to reflect the growth in the city’s Asian population: Since the 2010 census, New York City has added 630,000 new residents, 55 percent of whom are Asian.The maps call for the creation of a majority Asian district in Brooklyn, but rejected a proposal for a second such district representing Richmond Hill and South Ozone Park in Queens.Members of the APA Voice Redistricting Task Force have said that the growing South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities in those Queens neighborhoods should be united so they can elect their own representative.Instead, the commission’s proposed and revised maps split those ethnic groups among two City Council districts, diluting their power instead of recognizing it, neighborhood residents said. Under the revised maps, South Ozone Park will be in the 28th District and Richmond Hill will be in the 29th.The lack of ethnicity-focused representation became apparent when the remnants of Hurricane Ida flooded basement apartments in Queens, and when a recent fire among several townhouses in Richmond Hill killed three people. After those tragedies, the community had trouble marshaling help from the city, speakers from the task force recently said.“From lack of access to Covid-19 resources, immigration services, food insecurity, housing and economic disenfranchisement, rising rates of anti-Sikh hate crimes and political disenfranchisement, our elected officials have ignored our South Asian and Caribbean communities,” said Mohamed Q. Amin, founder and executive director of the Caribbean Equality Project.In Brooklyn, efforts by the Asian Wave Alliance helped gather more than 4,000 comments in support of keeping the Asian majority district in the borough. Under the revised map, the district will include parts of Sunset Park, Dyker Heights and Bensonhurst.A voting rights act expert hired by the commission found that the new map complied with the law by maintaining Black and Latino districts and increasing the opportunity for Asians to elect a candidate of their choosing.Yiatin Chu, president of the Asian Wave Alliance, said she’s hopeful the district will remain in the final maps because the Asian community is not politically “mature” and is still learning how to move the levers of power.“We actually need a majority to even have a shot because we’re not registered, we’re not participating in primaries and we’re not turning out enough,” Ms. Chu said.The City Council will review the new maps. They could accept them but have the option of voting against the plan and suggesting their own changes before sending it back to the commission, which could make additional changes.“We know it’s no secret that the original maps were not favorable to most, and I’ll just put that mildly,” said Adrienne Adams, the Council speaker.Many agreed that the root cause of some of the more objectionable changes in the first set of district maps was a decision to keep all three of Staten Island’s districts in that borough, as opposed to having at least one cross into Brooklyn.The city is legally required to have no more than a 5 percent population gap between the least populous and most populous Council districts, so to keep all three Staten Island districts intact meant rejiggering numerous districts in other boroughs.Under the new maps, District 50 on Staten Island will now cross the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and incorporate the Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn and a small part of Bath Beach, contours that more closely resemble the 11th Congressional District. That change allowed for a domino effect of other changes: Most of Hell’s Kitchen is now within one district; Rochdale Village will remain in one Queens district; Red Hook and most of Sunset Park will remain in one district in Brooklyn.Once the commission votes to approve a revised plan, neither the mayor nor the City Council has the power to change the map. The new lines will be used in next year’s City Council elections and remain in place for the next decade.Citizens Union, a good government group that has monitored the redistricting process, praised the commission for holding 10 public hearings since the process began. But because those meetings lacked full quorums, the group was concerned that the 15-member commission appointed by Mayor Eric Adams, the Council speaker and the Council Republican minority leader, Joseph Borelli, have done their actual deliberations outside of public view.Those private discussions have fueled accusations that Mr. Borelli has orchestrated a voting bloc, consisting of his three appointees and the mayor’s seven appointees, to give Staten Island an upper hand and to create more districts that are winnable by Republicans in an overwhelmingly Democratic city. Mr. Borelli said his desire to keep Staten Island whole was no secret, and that not doing so will only create other issues.“In the last maps, everyone’s unhappiness was merely based on Staten Island,” Mr. Borelli said. Now that the districting commission is exploring other designs, he expects that “a whole new crop of discord will arise.”</body>

	<title>Sweden Is Becoming Unbearable</title>
	<author>Elisabeth Asbrink</author>
	<body>STOCKHOLM — “Helg seger.”Those two words, spoken by Rebecka Fallenkvist, a 27-year-old media figure and politician from the Sweden Democrats, the far-right party that took 20 percent in Sweden’s general election last week, sent shivers down spines throughout the country. It’s not the phrase, which is odd and means “weekend victory.” It’s the sound: one letter away from “Hell seger,” the Swedish translation of the Nazi salute “Sieg Heil,” and the war cry of Swedish Nazis for decades.Ms. Fallenkvist was quick to disavow any Nazi associations. She meant to declare the weekend a victorious one, she said, but the words came out in the wrong order. Perhaps that’s true. But the statement would be entirely in keeping with the party Ms. Fallenkvist represents, which, after a steady rise, is now likely to play a major role in the next government.For Sweden, a country that trades on being a bastion of social democracy, tolerance and fairness, it’s a shock. But perhaps it shouldn’t be. Steadily rising for the past decade, the Swedish far right has profited from the country’s growing inequalities, fostering an obsession with crime and an antipathy to migrants. Its advance marks the end of Swedish exceptionalism, the idea that the country stood out both morally and materially.There’s no doubt about the party’s Nazi origins. The Sweden Democrats was created in 1988 out of a neo-Nazi group called B.S.S., or Keep Sweden Swedish, and of the party’s 30 founding fathers, 18 had Nazi affiliations, according to a historian and former party member, Tony Gustaffson. Some of the founding fathers had even served in Hitler’s Waffen SS.Step by step the party changed its image — in 1995 uniforms were forbidden — but the core ideology remained: Immigrants should be persuaded to go home, Swedish culture should be protected and neither Jews nor the Indigenous Sami people were to be considered “real Swedes.” Not even the soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic secured the party’s approval, although he was born in the country and is the national team’s record goal scorer. The stances of the current leadership, which has sought to sanitize the party’s reputation, are equally worrying.Take Linus Bylund, the party’s chief of staff in the Swedish Parliament. In an interview in 2020, he declared that journalists for the national public service radio and television ought to be “punished” if their reporting was biased. Such people, he stated previously, would be “enemies of the nation.” Proximity to power hasn’t softened his views. The day after the recent election, a reporter asked him what he now looked forward to. “Journalist-rugby,” he replied.Jimmie Akesson, the party’s leader, also surprised a television audience in mid-February when he refused to choose between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin. It’s of a piece with the party’s accommodating stance on Russia: The Swedish Parliament was so concerned about a journalist who used to work in the party’s office and had contact with Russian intelligence that it denied the journalist accreditation. Add in a cohort of representatives more prosecuted for crimes than any other, organized troll campaigns against opponents and even attempts to undermine faith in the electoral system, and you have the image of a deeply unsavory party.Even so, the Sweden Democrats’ rise is an impressive right-wing success story. The party entered the Parliament in 2010 with just over 5 percent of the vote — but, under the leadership of Mr. Akesson, it built an efficient, nationwide organization. It more than doubled its share of the vote in 2014 and, after Sweden admitted over 160,000 Syrian refugees, grew even more in the 2018 election. But it’s in this vote that Sweden Democrats secured a sought-after breakthrough with a stunning 20.6 percent of the votes, surpassing the conservative Moderaterna, which had been Sweden’s second biggest party for over 40 years. Now only the Social Democratic Party, Sweden’s historic party of government, has more support.This monumental rise is thanks to the dramatic changes in Swedish life over the past three decades. Once one of the most economically equal countries in the world, Sweden has seen the privatization of hospitals, schools and care homes, leading to a notable rise in inequality and a sense of profound loss. The idea of Sweden as a land of equal opportunity, safe from the plagues of extreme left and extreme right, is gone. This obscure collective feeling was waiting for a political response — and the Sweden Democrats have been the most successful in providing it. It was better in the good old days, they say, and people believe them. Back to red cottages and apple trees, to law and order, to women being women and men being men.For opening this door, the major parties have themselves to blame. Bit by bit, the traditional parties have adopted the point of view and rhetoric on crime and immigrations of the Sweden Democrats Party — but this strategy hasn’t won back any votes. On the contrary, it seems to have helped the far right. In a little more than 12 years, Sweden Democrats has managed to compete with the Social Democrats for working-class voters, with Moderaterna for the support of entrepreneurs and with the Centre Party among the rural population.The media is culpable, too. In an attempt to protect traditional Swedish democratic values, the mainstream media has often shunned and canceled Sweden Democrats officials and supporters, especially in the party’s early years. But now it seems that this response actually might have had the opposite effect. Individuals leaning toward the Sweden Democrats for various reasons have felt stigmatized: Some haven’t been invited to family gatherings, and in a few cases have even lost their jobs. This has not only fed the party’s self-image as a martyr but also nurtured even more loyalty among its supporters.One could argue that the traditional parties have had their part in creating the perfect storm. The Social Democratic Party has named the Sweden Democrats their main enemy in the election campaign, making other alternatives almost invisible in the public debate. Us or them, was the strategy. Many, predominantly male Swedes, chose the Sweden Democrats. As for a conservative party like Moderaterna, they have seen their voters abandon them for Sweden Democrats, and so Moderaterna reacted by emphasizing the similarities between the two parties until it reached a point where it became hard to distinguish any differences at all.The result is now plain to see. The Social Democrats, though the largest party, are unable to form a government. Instead, a conservative bloc, led by Ulf Kristersson from Moderaterna, will attempt to take office — as long as it has the support of the Sweden Democrats. Effectively a kingmaker, the party is now one of the most successful far-right parties in Europe since World War II.It’s a terrifying truth. But we must bear in mind that the majority of the country’s population is not among the Sweden Democrats’ ranks. These people want solutions to real problems — such as a worrying spike in gang and drug-related shootings in several cities — without recourse to ethnic blame games and the vilification of “un-Swedish” culture. As a liberal democrat I will never approve of a party that celebrates its success with references to Hitler’s Nazi ideology, no matter the claim that only by sheer coincidence was the exclamation “Helg Seger” just one letter apart from a Nazi war cry.Elisabeth Asbrink is the author of “1947: Where Now Begins,” “Made in Sweden: 25 Ideas That Created a Country” and “And in Wienerwald the Trees Remain.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Western Nations Will Take Temperature on Proposed Russian Oil Price Cap</title>
	<author>Edward Wong</author>
	<body>The United States and its European and Asian allies are at a pivotal point this week on sanctions on Russia and the urgent issue of energy prices as they discuss how to increase punishments on Moscow at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.Finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations have formally supported the concept of a price cap on purchases of Russian oil, aimed at reducing the revenue that Russia gets from oil and squeezing its economy further as President Vladimir V. Putin continues his war in Ukraine.But officials from those nations have yet to finalize a mechanism for the price cap or decide on the price itself, which is difficult to do because of the complexities of energy markets.American and European officials want to avoid sending energy prices soaring before the arrival of winter. European leaders are already grappling with high energy prices and their potential impact on domestic politics. Mr. Putin has cut off some natural gas exports to European countries, in what the Biden administration calls a “weaponization” of energy supplies.U.S. officials and their partners are also expected to try to persuade countries outside the Group of 7 to abide by whatever price cap is set. That includes China, India and Turkey, as well as other countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.“The oil price cap — if that’s going to work at all — is dependent on these countries’ willingness to follow the rules established by the West,” said Maria Snegovaya, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University who has written about sanctions on Russia.Some U.S. officials say it might not be necessary to get big purchasers like China and India to formally sign onto the price cap mechanism and be part of the coalition. They say those nations will use the cap to negotiate lower prices for Russian oil, which would still cut into Russia’s revenue.U.S. officials have also been debating a more hard-line option: strengthening a price cap by threatening so-called secondary sanctions against companies from other countries that do not abide by such a cap. But officials say the Biden administration is not likely to take that approach.American officials will use meetings this week at the United Nations and on the sidelines of the General Assembly to gauge the reactions from various countries to a price cap. American officials are also talking with counterparts from countries that have avoided direct condemnation of Russia to try to persuade them to make clear statements on the war or to join the sanctions coalition.President Biden is expected to try to rally greater support for Ukraine when he speaks to the General Assembly on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is scheduled to address the assembly by video on the same day.“The U.N. provides the platform for U.S. policymakers to incentivize these countries to join in the sanctions and prevent Russia’s active attempts to launch new diplomatic platforms outside of established venues like the U.N.,” Ms. Snegovaya said.Given all the pressures on the nations in the sanctions coalition, including outcries from their residents over rising energy prices, U.S. officials will also need to expend enormous energy on diplomacy to keep the coalition unified, analysts say.“Keeping the sanctions in place takes an enormous amount of leadership,” said John Gans, a former Pentagon official and author of “White House Warriors,” a history of the National Security Council. “If you don’t give priority to it, then it’ll fall to the wayside.”</body>

	<title>‘Serial’: Season 1</title>
	<author>Serial Productions</author>
	<body>If you’ve already listened to “Serial,” here’s an update on Adnan Syed’s case that we published on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2022, following breaking news. If you haven’t listened, start episode one below.A high school senior named Hae Min Lee disappeared one day after school in 1999, in Baltimore County, Md. A month later, her body was found in a city park. She’d been strangled. Her 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, was charged with murder, and within a year, he was sentenced to life in prison. The case against him was largely based on the story of one witness, Adnan’s friend Jay, who testified that he had helped Adnan bury Hae’s body. But Adnan has always maintained that he had nothing to do with Hae’s death. Some people believe he has been telling the truth. Many others don’t.Sarah Koenig sorted through thousands of documents, listened to trial testimony and police interrogations and talked to everyone she could find who remembered Adnan Syed and Hae Min Lee. Sarah discovered that the trial had covered up a far more complicated story than the jury — or the public — ever got to hear. The high school scene, the shifting statements to the police, the prejudices, the sketchy alibis, the scant forensic evidence — everything leads back to the most basic questions: How can you know a person’s character? How can you tell what a person is capable of? In Season 1 of “Serial,” she looks for answers.It’s Baltimore, 1999. Hae Min Lee, a popular high school senior, disappears after school one day. Six weeks later, detectives arrest her classmate and ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, for her murder. He says he’s innocent — though he can’t exactly remember what he was doing on that January afternoon.But someone can. A classmate at Woodlawn High School says she knows where Adnan was. The trouble is, she’s nowhere to be found.Their relationship began like a storybook high school romance: a prom date, love notes, sneaking off to be alone. But unlike other kids at school, they had to keep their dating secret because their parents disapproved. Both of them, but especially Adnan Syed, were under special pressure at home, and that stress spilled over into their relationship. Eventually Hae broke up with Adnan.And then, depending on whom you ask, Adnan was either understandably sad and moping around or full of rage and plotting to kill her.It’s Feb. 9, 1999. Hae has been missing for three weeks. A man on his lunch break pulls off a road to pee and stumbles on her body in a city forest. His odd recounting of the discovery makes Detectives William Ritz and Greg MacGillivary suspicious.For instance, why did he walk so far into the woods — 127 feet — to relieve himself? And that’s just the start. A look into the man’s past reveals some bizarre behavior.A few days after Hae’s body is found, the detectives get a lead that opens the case up for them. They find Jay at work late one night and bring him down to Homicide. At first, he insists he doesn’t know anything about the murder. But eventually he comes clean. He tells them what happened on Jan. 13.A few weeks later, he’s back at Homicide, and his story has changed. In some ways, these changes are small and understandable. In other ways, they’re big and confounding.Adnan once issued a challenge to Sarah. He told her to test the state’s timeline of the murder by driving from Woodlawn High School to Best Buy in 21 minutes. It can’t be done, he said. So Sarah and Dana take up the challenge and raise him one: They try to recreate the entire route that Jay said he and Adnan had taken on Jan. 13, 1999.The physical evidence against Adnan Syed was scant — a few underwhelming fingerprints. So aside from cellphone records, what did the prosecutors bring to the jury, to shore up Jay’s testimony? Sarah weighs all the other circumstantial evidence they had against Adnan, including curious behavior, a disconcerting note and an unexplained midafternoon phone call.Adnan told Sarah about a case in Virginia that had striking similarities to his own: one key witness, incriminating cellphone records, young people, drugs — and a defendant who has always maintained his innocence. Sarah called up one of the defense lawyers on that case to apply any insight into Adnan’s case and got much more than she had bargained for.The state’s case against Adnan Syed hinged on Jay’s credibility; he was the star witness and also, because of his changing statements to the police, the chief liability. Naturally, Adnan’s lawyer tried hard to make Jay look untrustworthy at trial. So how did the jurors make sense of Jay? For that matter, how did the cops make sense of Jay? How are we supposed to make sense of Jay?While Adnan’s memory of that January day is foggy at best, he does remember what happened next: being questioned, being arrested and, a little more than a year later, being sentenced to life in prison.Adnan’s trial lawyer was M. Cristina Gutierrez, a renowned defense attorney in Maryland — tough, savvy and smart. Other lawyers said she was exactly the kind of person you’d want defending you on a first-degree murder charge. But Adnan was convicted, and a year later his lawyer was disbarred. What happened?Almost everyone described the 17-year-old Adnan Syed the same way: good kid, helpful at the mosque, respectful to his elders. But a couple of months ago, Sarah started getting phone calls from people who had known Adnan back then.On Jan. 13, 1999, Adnan Syed was a hurt and vengeful ex-boyfriend who carried out a premeditated murder. Or, he was a bewildered bystander, framed for a crime he could never have committed. After 15 months of reporting, we take out everything we’ve got — interviews, documents and police reports — we shake it all out, and we see what sticks.When it launched in 2014, “Serial” became a global sensation that has been credited with launching the modern era of audio journalism. The New York Times Company acquired Serial Productions in 2020.Hosting and executive production by Sarah Koenig; executive production by Julie Snyder; production by Dana Chivvis; line production by Emily Condon; editorial advising by Ira Glass; scoring by Nick Thorburn; scoring and sound engineering by Mark Henry Phillips; mixing for episode 13 by Mike Comite.</body>

	<title>Mental Health Is Political</title>
	<author>Danielle Carr</author>
	<body>What if the cure for our current mental health crisis is not more mental health care?The mental health toll of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the subject of extensive commentary in the United States, much of it focused on the sharp increase in demand for mental health services now swamping the nation’s health care capacities. The resulting difficulty in accessing care has been invoked widely as justification for a variety of proposed solutions, such as the profit-driven growth of digital health and teletherapy start-ups and a new mental health plan that the Biden administration unveiled earlier this year.But are we really in a mental health crisis? A crisis that affects mental health is not the same thing as a crisis of mental health. To be sure, symptoms of crisis abound. But in order to come up with effective solutions, we first have to ask: a crisis of what?Some social scientists have a term — “reification” — for the process by which the effects of a political arrangement of power and resources start to seem like objective, inevitable facts about the world. Reification swaps out a political problem for a scientific or technical one; it’s how, for example, the effects of unregulated tech oligopolies become “social media addiction,” how climate catastrophe caused by corporate greed becomes a “heat wave” — and, by the way, how the effect of struggles between labor and corporations combines with high energy prices to become “inflation.” Examples are not scarce.For people in power, the reification sleight of hand is very useful because it conveniently abracadabras questions like “Who caused this thing?” and “Who benefits?” out of sight. Instead, these symptoms of political struggle and social crisis begin to seem like problems with clear, objective technical solutions — problems best solved by trained experts. In medicine, examples of reification are so abundant that sociologists have a special term for it: “medicalization,” or the process by which something gets framed as primarily a medical problem. Medicalization shifts the terms in which we try to figure out what caused a problem, and what can be done to fix it. Often, it puts the focus on the individual as a biological body, at the expense of factoring in systemic and infrastructural conditions.Once we begin to ask questions about medicalization, the entire framing of the mental health toll of the Covid crisis — an “epidemic” of mental illness, as various publications have called it, rather than a political crisis with medical effects — begins to seem inadequate.Of course, nobody can deny that there has been an increase in mental and emotional distress. To take two of the most common diagnoses, a study published in 2021 in The Lancet estimated that the pandemic had caused an additional 53.2 million cases of major depressive disorder and 76.2 million cases of anxiety disorder globally.Let’s think about this. The fact that incidences of psychological distress have increased in the face of objectively distressing circumstances is hardly surprising. As a coalition of 18 prominent mental health scholars wrote in a 2020 paper in The Lancet: “Predictions of a ‘tsunami’ of mental health problems as a consequence of [Covid] and the lockdown are overstated; feelings of anxiety and sadness are entirely normal reactions to difficult circumstances, not symptoms of poor mental health.”Things get even less surprising when you look more closely at the data: If you bracket the (entirely predictable) spike in psychological distress among health care workers (a fact that itself only reinforces the idea that the major causal vectors in play here are structural), the most relevant predictors of mental health are indexes of economic security. Of course, it’s not simply a question of the numbers on your bank statement — although that is a major predictor of outcomes — but of whether you live in a society where the social fabric has been destroyed.Before we go further, let me be clear about what I am not arguing. I am not arguing that mental illnesses are fake, or somehow nonbiological. Pointing out the medicalization of social and political problems does not mean denying that such problems produce real biological conditions; it means asking serious questions about what is causing those conditions. If someone is driving through a crowd, running people over, the smart move is not to declare an epidemic of people suffering from Got Run Over by a Car Syndrome and go searching for the underlying biological mechanism that must be causing it. You have to treat the very real suffering that is happening in the bodies of the people affected, obviously, but the key point is this: You’re going to have to stop the guy running over people with the car.This principle is what some health researchers mean by the idea that there are social determinants of health — that effective long-term solutions for many medicalized problems require nonmedical — this is to say, political — means. We all readily acknowledge that for diseases like diabetes and hypertension — diseases with a very clear biological basis — an individual’s body is only part of the causal reality of the disease. Treating the root cause of the “epidemic” of diabetes effectively, for example, would happen at the level of serious infrastructural changes to the available diet and activity levels of a population, not by slinging medications or pouring funding into clinics that help people make better choices in supermarkets filled with unregulated, unhealthy food. You’ve got to stop the guy running over people with the car.But if the public health consensus around diabetes has shifted somewhat in response to what we know, it’s been remarkably hard to achieve the same when it comes to mental health.Psychiatric sciences have long acknowledged the fact that stress is causally implicated in an enormous range of mental disorders, referring to the “stress-diathesis model” of mental illness. That model incorporates the well-documented fact that chronic stressors (like poverty, political violence and discrimination) intensify the chance that an individual will develop a given diagnosis, from depression to schizophrenia.The causal relationship may be even more direct. Remarkably, all throughout decades of research on mood disorders, scientists doing animal studies had to create animal models of anxiety and depression — that is, animals who showed behaviors that looked like human anxiety and depression — by subjecting them to weeks or months of chronic stress. Zap animals with unpredictable and painful shocks they can’t escape, force them to survive barely survivable conditions for long enough, put them in social situations where they are chronically brutalized by those higher up in the social hierarchy — and just like that, the animals will consistently start behaving in a way that looks like human psychopathology.This doesn’t mean that all psychiatric symptoms are caused by stress, but it does mean that a whole lot of them almost certainly are. There is increasingly strong evidence for the idea that chronic elevation of stress hormones has downstream effects on the neural architecture of the brain’s cognitive and emotional circuits. The exact relationship between different types of stress and any given cluster of psychiatric symptoms remains unclear — why do some people react to stress by becoming depressed, while others become impulsive or enraged? — indicating that whatever causal mechanism exists is mediated by a variety of genetic and social conditions. But the implications of the research are very clear: When it comes to mental health, the best treatment for the biological conditions underlying many symptoms might be ensuring that more people can live less stressful lives.And here is the core of the problem: Medicalizing mental health doesn’t work very well if your goal is to address the underlying cause of population-level increases in mental and emotional distress. It does, however, work really well if you’re trying to come up with a solution that everybody in power can agree on, so that the people in power can show they’re doing something about the problem. Unfortunately, the solution that everyone can agree on is not going to work.Everyone agrees, for instance, that it would be good to reduce the high rate of diabetes plaguing the United States. But once we begin to de-medicalize it, diabetes starts to look like a biological problem arising from a vast swathe of political problems: transportation infrastructure that keeps people sedentary in cars, food insecurity that keeps a racialized underclass dependent on cheap and empty calories, the power of corporate lobbies to defang regulations, and so on. These are problems that people do not agree on how to solve, in part because some are materially benefiting from this state of affairs. This is to say, these are political problems, and solving them will mean taking on the groups of people who benefit from the status quo.That the status quo is once again benefiting the usual suspects is all too obvious in the booming market of V.C.-backed mental health tech start-ups, which promise to solve the crisis through a gig economy model for psychiatric care that has been criticized for selling psychiatric medication irresponsibly, with little accountability.But even publicly funded solutions risk falling into the trap of medicalizing a problem and failing to address the deeper structural causes of the crisis. President Biden’s plan for mental health, for instance, makes many genuflections to the language of “community” and “behavioral health.” A section outlining a plan for “creating healthy environments” makes a great show of saying the right things, including: “We cannot transform mental health solely through the health care system. We must also address the determinants of behavioral health, invest in community services and foster a culture and environment that broadly promotes mental wellness and recovery.”But then the plan goes on to focus on several proposals aimed at regulating social media platforms — a strange target that seems relevant only in a downstream way from major infrastructural determinants of health, like wealth inequality and public services — until you remember that it’s one of the few policy goals that both Democrats and Republicans share.Sure, parts of the proposal do seem to offer genuinely needed care. For instance, a proposal to establish scores of behavioral health clinics that can offer subsidized substance use treatment like methadone tapering is an exigently needed — if depressingly belated — response to the phenomenon of mass opiate addiction pushed by corporations like Purdue Pharma and Walgreens.But despite the fact that much of the proposal seems to have been drafted with the opiate addiction crisis in mind, the billboard-size implications of the so-called opioid epidemic seem to have failed to register. It is hard to imagine a clearer demonstration of political conditions undergoing the reification switch into a medicalized epidemic than what everyone now knows happened: The despair of the post-industrial underclass was methodically and intentionally milked by pharmaceutical companies for all it was worth. It was so obvious that at last even a political establishment that remains largely indifferent to the poor eventually had to get around to sort of doing something.And yet when the plan addresses suicide, it focuses on crisis intervention — as if suicide were a kind of unfortunate natural occurrence, like lightning strikes, rather than an expression of the fact that growing numbers of people are becoming convinced that the current state of affairs gives them no reason to hope for a life they’d want to live.The proposal’s main plan to address the so-called epidemic of suicide has been the rebranding of a national suicide hotline — which will encourage callers on the brink of killing themselves to refrain from doing so, and may or may not connect them to resources like three cognitive behavioral therapy sessions (most likely conducted through teletherapy) that insurance companies will be required to cover for their customers — depending on what the state the caller is in has decided about funding. (Like all of Biden’s proposal, the plan is yet to be passed into law.) It’s not so much that the hotline is a bad idea; it’s that the sheer scale of failure to comprehend the political reality that it displays, the utter inability to register how profoundly the “suicide epidemic” indicts the status quo, is ultimately more terrifying than outright indifference. It’s worth recalling that in the 2016 presidential election, even though Hillary Clinton touted a “suicide prevention” campaign plank, communities most affected by so-called deaths of despair voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, who addressed, however disingenuously, their economic situation and promised to bring back jobs.Solving the mental health crisis, then, will require fighting for people to have secure access to infrastructure that buffers them from chronic stress: housing, food security, education, child care, job security, the right to organize for more humane workplaces and substantive action on the imminent climate apocalypse.A fight for mental health waged only on the terms of access to psychiatric care does not only risk bolstering justifications for profiteering invoked by start-ups eager to capitalize on the widespread effects of grief, anxiety and despair. It also risks pathologizing the very emotions we are going to need to harness for their political power if we are going to win solutions.Danielle Carr is an assistant professor at the Institute for Society and Genetics at U.C.L.A.

	<title>Perfectly Reasonable Question: Can We Trust the Polls?</title>
	<author>Nate Cohn</author>
	<body>Last Monday, I wrote about the early “warning signs” in this year’s Senate polling. Then three days later, I helped write up the results of a new national survey: a New York Times/Siena College poll showing Democrats up by two percentage points in the generic ballot among registered voters.If you thought that was a touch contradictory, you’re not alone. One person tweeted: “Didn’t you just write that the polls are an illusion? Why should we believe this one?”It’s a perfectly fair question, and it’s one I encounter regularly: Should I believe these polls — or not? It’s also a surprisingly complicated question to answer.This may sound obvious, but I’ll say it anyway: We believe our polls provide valuable information about voters and the state of the election. These polls are time-consuming, expensive and stressful, with considerable mental health and reputational costs when they wind up “wrong.” We would not be making this effort if we believed they were doomed to be useless.There are warning signs, yes — and we’ll track them in this newsletter. I do not think you should unquestioningly “believe” polls, at least not in the sense that you “believe” figures from an encyclopedia. Polls are not exact measurements, like the diameter of the Earth or the speed of light. They are imprecise estimates — and even the classic margin of error seriously understates the actual degree of uncertainty.But despite all the limitations, a 2020 polling error is not inevitable, either. In fact, our most recent survey showed some small signs of encouragement that 2022 polls may not be like those of 2020.I spent a week on a lake in Ontario last month, so forgive me for analogizing polling failures to a different kind of catastrophe: a boat capsizing in a violent storm.Like a rickety boat in a storm, the polling error in the last cycle required both difficult conditions — whether it’s rough waves or the lower likelihood that Trump voters participate in surveys — and a polling vessel that simply couldn’t handle the adversity.Nonetheless, we’re setting sail yet again this year.Is it a little scary? Yes. We pollsters are stuck with the same boats that flipped last time. We would like to buy something sturdier, but there isn’t anything better on the market. That’s not to say that we aren’t making changes, but many of our best ideas are the equivalent of tightening the screws and patching holes. Even with such changes, we can’t be confident that our ships today will withstand the storm we experienced in 2020.But are we doomed? No. For example, there’s a credible theory that the pandemic contributed to polling error, as safety-conscious liberals were more likely to be home during lockdowns (and answered telephone calls) while conservatives went out and lived their lives. With the lockdowns over, those tendencies may be, too.There’s also a credible theory that Donald J. Trump himself is an important factor. If so, polling could be more “normal” with him off the ballot.What you’ve read to this point is the nautical version of an analysis written by Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, who argued that the polls may not be wrong this fall. Although the piece is sort of framed as a rebuttal to mine, I don’t really disagree with any of it. Consider it recommended reading.There’s one big difference between polling after 2020 and setting sail the day after a storm: The sailor can probably find a weather forecast.We don’t get poll error warnings, but last week’s newsletter pointed to something about as close as it gets: surprising Democratic strength in exactly the same places where the polls overestimated Democrats last time. If you’ll permit this metaphor to continue, it’s an ominous cloud on the horizon. Dark clouds don’t necessarily mean there will be a fierce storm, but if there were going to be a storm, we’d see some dark clouds first. Similarly, this pattern in the state polling is exactly what we would expect to see if the polls were going to err in the same way they did two years ago.This week, I can report a new measurement of the conditions facing pollsters: whether Democrats or Republicans were likelier to respond to our latest Times/Siena survey.I wasn’t systematically tracking this in fall 2020 — this data is not always easy to collect and process, especially with everything else going on. But if I had been tracking the response by party, it would have been another warning sign.Looking back at our data from September and October 2020, white Democrats were 20 percent likelier to respond to Times/Siena polls than white Republicans. This disparity most likely betrayed a deeper problem: Trump voters, regardless of party, were less likely to respond to our polls.On this front, I have good news: The response rate by party is more balanced so far this cycle. In the national poll we released last week, white Democrats were only 5 percent likelier to complete the survey than white Republicans. That’s back down near the level of our October 2019 polling, when our early survey of a projected Biden-Trump contest came eerily close to the final result among likely voters. In those battleground state polls, white Democrats were 6 percent likelier to respond than Republicans, compared with a 23 percent gap in the fall 2020 polling of those same states.This is a good sign. Maybe — just maybe — our poll last week was closer to the mark than polls have been in recent cycles.Still, it’s worth imagining what might happen if the polls are off again by the same 2020 margin.Republicans would have been the ones leading our poll last week by two points among registered voters, instead of Democrats. It would certainly be a different race, but the story might not read very differently. We’d probably still characterize the contest as fairly competitive at the outset of a general campaign. That’s a little different than in 2020, when a four-point error made the difference between a Biden landslide and a fairly competitive race.If you think about it, there are a lot of cases when a 2020-like polling error can be quite tolerable. Does it make a huge difference whether 46 percent or 50 percent of Americans think the economy is good or excellent rather than poor or bad? What about whether Mr. Trump is at 54 percent or 58 percent in an early test of the 2024 primary? In contrast, polls of close partisan elections can be extremely sensitive: whether Mr. Biden has 46 percent or 50 percent of the vote could be the difference between a decisive eight-point victory or a clear victory for Mr. Trump, given the recent skew of the Electoral College.And it’s also worth noting that the polls contain valuable information, even when they miss on the horse race. In 2016, for instance, the pre-election polls showed Mr. Trump’s huge gains among white voters without a college degree.And last cycle, they showed Mr. Trump’s gains among Hispanics. These trends uncovered by polls continue to have import. If you missed it over the weekend, my colleagues analyzed the results of our poll that focused on Hispanics, in this article, based on these cross-tabs.</body>

	<title>A Red-Hot Affair With a Younger Man, and the Writing It Kindled</title>
	<author>Dwight Garner</author>
	<body>GETTING LOST, by Annie Ernaux | Translated by Alison L. StrayerHis fingernails are ragged. He wears designer suits but his choice of underwear, cheap Russian tighty-whities, is poignant. When he gets drunk, he talks about Stalin. He likes the dumbest game shows. Maybe he’s K.G.B. He does not know how to unfasten garters.The French writer Annie Ernaux’s new book, “Getting Lost,” comprises diary entries from 1988 through 1990; they recount her affair in Paris with a married Soviet diplomat. The sex is torrid, and described with a lemony eye for detail. “I realized that I’d lost a contact lens,” Ernaux writes. “I found it on his penis.”S, as she refers to him, is a younger man. He’s in his mid-30s. Ernaux is approaching 50 and fearful of aging out of the game — the only game, to her mind, alongside writing. Kissing S reminds her of being “kissed at age 18.” He gives her back “my 20-year-old self.”Young flesh as renewal: It’s a perennial theme in the work of male writers and their nifty alter egos. It’s rarer, and has more amperage, the other way around: Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson, Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde.Colette, in “Chéri,” wrote lucidly, and charmingly, about an older woman’s liaison with a younger man. The English writer Angela Carter described her relationship, when she was in her 30s, with a 19-year-old. “Every time I pull down his underpants,” she wrote in a letter, “I feel more &amp; more like Humbert Humbert.”(If she’d been a man, Carter wrote, and had the fortune to “seduce a girl 12 years younger than I who was as bright &amp; freaky &amp; pretty as Ko, everyone would applaud.” Instead, she sensed distaste. People seemed to think, “Clearly, she can’t get anyone else.”)Ernaux, who is now in her 80s, is the author of 20 or so works of fiction and memoir. Most of them are thin, bare and chapped, as if broadcast in mono instead of stereo. She has only recently begun to find a devoted audience in the United States.The almost primitive directness of her voice is bracing. It’s as if she’s carving each sentence onto the surface of a table with a knife. She is, in her writing, definitely not the sort of girl whose bicycle has a basket.Readers of Ernaux’s work will be familiar with the story in “Getting Lost.” She fictionalized it in her novel “Simple Passion,” which was published in France in 1991 and here in 2003.Each book has its merits. In “Simple Passion” she goes to the site of a long-ago trauma, after posing a question I’m not sure I’ve encountered in fiction: “Am I the only woman to return to the scene of an abortion?” This memorable scene does not exist in the later book.Yet many details overlap. “Simple Passion” was tiny, 67 pages, practically a chapbook; at 239 pages, “Getting Lost” is, for Ernaux, a monster work, her “From Here to Eternity” or “Infinite Jest.”I prefer the new book, agreeing with the author when she writes that in the diaries there is “something raw and dark, without salvation, a kind of oblation.” This is the version, in this idiomatic translation from the French by Alison L. Strayer, that was not tweaked in postproduction.S is not a brute. He’s slim and tall; he has green eyes and light brown hair. But he is dominant and she craves, at times, submission.The bedroom scenes are bulldozing. “S and I throw ourselves at each other”; “my face bruised and blotched with kisses”; “three times in four hours”; “there isn’t much left of the Kama Sutra for us to do”; “I want to keep a G-string soaked with his sperm under my pillow.”It’s a love siege, a flood peak of existence, this affair that lasts a year or so. She crosses some unmarked border, and can’t get back. No daylight law, no rationality, seems to hold. The bulk of “Getting Lost” describes Ernaux’s agony as she waits for his return.This book is an anthology of her projected anxieties. Her heart is some sort of nocturnal beast, caught by her own tripwire and camera. The drama is underscored by the pay phones he uses to call her; iPhones would have spoiled this book.Ernaux fears the humiliation of being tossed aside. She writes, “I have no future, other than the date of our next meeting.” It’s a point she makes dozens of times. Our exhaustion shapes this book’s content and drives home her own exhaustion, her utter obsession.Her journal, which she has kept on and off since adolescence, is a stabilizing force. Writing in it “was a way of enduring the wait until we saw each other again, of heightening the pleasure by recording the words and acts of passion. Most of all, it was a way to save life, save from nothingness the thing that most resembles it.”She was unable, throughout the affair, during which the Berlin Wall fell, to write anything else except a few perfunctory articles. One of this book’s primary themes is the uniquely primal nature of both sex and writing. Once the former is gone, she senses, the latter will be her only way to connect.How fundamental is writing to Ernaux’s personality? Well, she forgave her former husband’s infidelity — they were separated before her affair with the Russian began — on the grounds that he couldn’t write and was thus, in some senses, crippled. “What else is there to do when you don’t write?” she asks. “Eat, drink and make love.”“Getting Lost” is a feverish book. It’s about being impaled by desire, and about the things human beings want, as opposed to the things for which they settle. Is it a major book? Probably not. But it’s one of those books about loneliness that, on every page, makes you feel less alone.GETTING LOST | By Annie Ernaux | Translated by Alison L.

	<title>Who gets to use gas?</title>
	<author>Somini Sengupta</author>
	<body>Today’s newsletter is devoted to one of the most consequential arguments roiling the climate world: Which countries, if any, should start new gas projects now, and for what purpose?The question has taken on new urgency as the war in Ukraine scrambles the global energy system and prompts European leaders to try to replace Russian gas with supplies from elsewhere. Italy has scored deals to buy gas from Angola and the Republic of Congo. German leaders are trying to sign deals with Senegal.Leaders of some gas-rich countries in Africa have an answer. They’re eager to extract more of their riches, especially at a time when prices are high. They’re eager for investments. And they point out that greenhouse gas emissions from the continent have contributed little to the climate crisis.African government ministers meeting in Egypt this month called on world leaders to “avoid approaches that encourage abrupt disinvestments from fossil fuels.”Expect this debate to unfold in public and behind closed doors as presidents and prime ministers gather in New York at the United Nations General Assembly this week, and later this fall COP27, the year’s big climate summit in Egypt.I’ve been listening to people on different sides. Here’s the gist of what I’ve learned.Does gas pollute?Gas is often called natural gas, because, like all fossil fuels, it’s derived from nature. But it would be more accurate to call it methane gas, because methane is its principal ingredient.When burned to produce heat or electricity, gas is cleaner than coal. When it escapes unburned, though, it heats up the atmosphere super fast. A lot of methane leaks from pipelines and tanks.Currently, the United States and Russia are the world’s largest gas producers.Why the focus on Africa?According to the International Energy Agency, 600 million people in Africa lack access to electricity, and 970 million live without low-pollution cooking fuels, which consigns mostly women and girls to burning charcoal and wood in their kitchens. More shocking, a smaller share of the population has access to electricity today than in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic.That problem could be solved by 2030 with investments of $25 billion a year, according to the I.E.A. — a fraction of what’s invested in global energy today.Is gas necessary to widen energy access for Africans?Renewables, especially solar and geothermal energy, could meet 80 percent of the electricity generation capacity needed, according to the I.E.A. The same projections conclude that, between now and 2030, Africa would also need gas (around 90 billion cubic meters a year) to generate the electricity needed to produce things like cement, steel, and fertilizers.Gas or no gas is the wrong question, said Damilola Ogunbiyi, a native of Nigeria who now serves as the United Nations special representative for Sustainable Energy for All. The right question is how to expand access to energy. At the moment, she said, that is not possible without some gas.“Lifting 600 million people out of poverty, that has to be the front line item of the energy transition,” Ogunbiyi told me. “Giving, you know, a few million Africans some solar lanterns, that is not development. Development is to have enough electricity that you can run your small business, so you can manufacture.”Pushback: Gas for whom?Some African climate activists argue that the extraction of the continent’s natural resources has not served its people well. Nigeria is the continent’s largest oil producer, and even some villages in its oil-rich delta live in darkness. South Africa is rich in coal, but while exports to Europe have surged, South Africans deal with power cuts. A new pipeline is under construction to transport crude oil from Uganda to a port in Tanzania, from where it can be exported to buyers abroad. It faces pushback from climate activists in the region.The Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate described gas as “a dangerous distraction.”“Decades of fossil fuel development in Africa have already failed to deliver promised prosperity,” she said by email. “We need finance from the Global North for cheap and reliable renewable energy instead.”Investing in new gas projects, especially for export to Europe, carries a risk, argued Mohamed Adow, a Kenyan climate campaigner. African countries could end up with expensive pipelines and other infrastructure that’s no longer needed in the coming years as the world shifts to renewables, which are becoming ever cheaper.“Attempts to expand gas production in Africa are not being done to tackle energy poverty but for export, largely to rich, energy-hungry countries in the Global North,” he said. “This dash for gas is to make a quick buck whilst countries in Europe face a short-term energy squeeze.”He called it “folly.”If Africa developed its gas resources, how would that affect global emissions?The I.E.A. projected the emissions footprint of the continent’s untapped gas reserves. If it develops its known reserves, Africa’s cumulative carbon dioxide emissions over the next 30 years would amount to around 10 metric gigatons.The countries of sub-Saharan Africa account for around 3 percent of global historic emissions today. “If these emissions were added to Africa’s cumulative total today, they would bring its share of global emissions to a mere 3.5 percent,” the energy agency concluded.The Times is running a series of virtual climate events leading up to COP27, this year’s big climate summit in Egypt in November. The first one, with Al Gore, John Kerry and others, is today, Sept. 20, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern time.

	<title>One Frustrated Hamptons Buyer Opts for an Alternative: Build It Yourself</title>
	<author>Tim McKeough</author>
	<body>When Amanda Brezing began looking for a summer house in the Hamptons in 2017, she encountered a common problem.“Things seemed kind of expensive, and nothing was really what I wanted,” said Ms. Brezing, 36, who works in finance in Manhattan. “So I decided to look at land.”Hiring an architect to design a house she loved would surely provide better value, she figured. She didn’t have the budget for an oceanfront estate, but she was able to find a roughly half-acre lot planted with trees on a quiet cul-de-sac in Springs, a hamlet in East Hampton, N.Y., backing onto a nature preserve.After buying the lot for $337,500 in August 2018, Ms. Brezing began looking for an architect, hoping to find a small, local firm where the principals would be closely involved in the project. “It was really important for me that they share the same vision I did for wanting calming, thoughtful elements in the design, as well as something very modern,” she said.Ms. Brezing also wanted a home that would support indoor-outdoor living and have enough space to comfortably entertain friends and relatives. “I have a large family with three sisters, and I’ve never really been able to host them in my smaller apartments in New York City,” she said. “So I wanted a space that had these functional areas where we could all gather and create memories together.”After interviewing several candidates, she hired Oza Sabbeth Architects, a firm with offices in Bridgehampton and Manhattan that had built a few nearby homes she admired. The company offered a turnkey design-build service through its construction arm, Modern Green Home.When its founders, Nilay Oza and Peter Sabbeth, visited the site, they immediately saw a challenge: Ms. Brezing wanted privacy, but she had neighbors on both sides and across the street.“The lots are fairly small, and lined up in more of a suburban way,” Mr. Oza said.“The only place you could look and not see another house was out the back,” Mr. Sabbeth added.A typical approach for such a lot, Mr. Oza said, would be to build the house near the street, creating a big backyard and installing just a few small windows on the sides. But they knew that wouldn’t achieve what Ms. Brezing wanted. So they decided to split the house into a few distinct components that could be assembled around outdoor spaces at the center.“We decided to contain the views by creating these interior courtyards,” Mr. Oza said.The 3,000-square-foot design they conceived has three connected volumes: The first, close to the street, contains three guest rooms. The second, also close to the street, contains the garage. And the third — connected to the first two by a glass-walled corridor that runs past planted courtyards — contains the main living and dining space, the kitchen and the primary suite. From there, a long pergola extends over an outdoor dining area with a fireplace and leads to the pool deck.Each volume is clad in the Hamptons’ signature cedar shingles, but with an asymmetrical pyramidal roof topped by glass, creating a striking form on the outside and a high ceiling inside. And every part of the house is designed to respond to particular views, “like that outdoor seating area by the fireplace, or a very well-landscaped courtyard,” said Mr. Oza, whose firm collaborated with Geoffrey Nimmer Landscapes on the grounds.Inside, the architects worked with Henrybuilt on the kitchen, bathroom vanities and closets. In the primary bathroom, they added steel reinforcements inside walls to support a hammock-like carbon-fiber bathtub from Splinterworks that Ms. Brezing found.In the end, construction costs came to about $800 a square foot; Ms. Brezing took out a construction loan to pay for most of it. Modern Green Home broke ground in the fall of 2019 and completed the house in January 2022 after pandemic-related delays.When it came time to furnish the house, Ms. Brezing interviewed a few interior designers before deciding to slow down.“Truth be told, furniture is very expensive,” she said. “I wanted to be in the space for a little while to figure out what I wanted, but I also just needed to be mindful of how much money I wanted to spend.”Rather than buying everything at once, she rented most of the furniture from Meridith Baer Home, and has gradually been replacing some of it with pieces of her own. The rental furniture has allowed her to figure out what works best for her lifestyle. The outdoor lounge chairs, for instance, came with cushions that get dirty and are a pain to clean, she said, “so I will not be getting permanent lounge chairs with cushions.”As she figures out the furniture, Ms. Brezing has been spending as much time at the house as she can, with her sisters and friends. And the process of working with Oza Sabbeth was exactly what she hoped for.“The house is really special, and it was really fun to work with them,” she said. “They were willing to take risks, and I was willing to go with them.”For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.</body>

	<title>In ‘Reboot,’ Everything Old Is New, to Streaming</title>
	<author>Alexis Soloski</author>
	<body>At a recent meeting at Hulu’s offices, over coffee and luxury bottled water, half a dozen executives entertained a pitch for a new series. Well, not exactly new. The idea: Reboot the beloved early ’00s comedy about a blended family, “Step Right Up.” Though it ended abruptly after its lead departed, the show has, surprisingly, found a robust audience on streaming, particularly among, an analytics specialist notes, the family and “live-to-laugh” quadrants.“Are we sure that’s not just people leaving it on for their dogs?” a colleague asks.Her boss voices a further concern: Are reboots still a thing? His team answers him with a very long list, which includes “Fuller House,” “How I Met Your Father,” “Veronica Mars,” “Gilmore Girls,” “Gossip Girl,” “The Wonder Years,” “Party of Five,” “Party Down” and on and on and on.“What the hell,” the boss says, convinced. “Let’s remake something original.”This is the opening scene of “Reboot,” a Hulu half-hour comedy from the showrunner Steven Levitan (“Modern Family,” “Just Shoot Me!”) with a premise so flawless it seems bananas that no one has thought of it before. A turducken of a show, it features a multicamera family comedy, nested inside a single camera workplace comedy, shoved into a behind-the-scenes Hollywood spoof. The series is also a referendum — a pretty fun one — on the way that the sitcom has advanced in the past several decades and its migration from network to cable and streaming.“This really is an affectionate look at our business,” Levitan said, speaking from a home office with “Modern Family” cutouts in the background. “The bizarre characters, the weird situations, the important meetings you have over something that’s unbelievably trivial and embarrassing. It’s really such great fodder for comedy.”Levitan first had the idea for “Reboot” several years ago when “Roseanne” returned and then disappeared, following a racist tweet posted by its star, Roseanne Barr, and then returned again, sans Barr, as “The Conners.” The presumed backstage drama intrigued him.“I remember thinking to myself, Well, that’s the show I want to watch,” he said. “Modern Family” still had a few seasons to go. He assumed that someone else would dream up the same idea in the meantime, but no one did. Or no one was greenlit, anyway. So he took his pitch to Hulu. (He has an overall deal with 20th Television, which is, like Hulu, part of the Walt Disney Company.)I asked Karey Burke, the president of 20th Television, who helped to develop “Reboot,” if Hulu’s real-life executives had ever expressed any qualms about the show’s satire. (There’s a dazzling swipe at “The Handmaid’s Tale” in the pilot, for example.)“They love it,” she said. “And I don’t know that other platforms would be able to handle the zingers as gracefully as they have.”Craig Erwich, the president of ABC Entertainment, Hulu and Disney branded television streaming originals, confirmed this, saying that he and his real colleagues enjoyed being in on the joke. “We loved it,” he said. “It’s funny. And it’s funny because it probably rings true.”Not all of these jokes target streaming services. A bunch take aim at networks, where Levitan spent most of his career. Others go after changes within the form of the sitcom itself. Many of these last are voiced in the form of arguments between Paul Reiser’s Gordon, who created “Step Right Up,” and Rachel Bloom’s Hannah, the millennial writer-director who pitched the reboot.“Comedy has evolved since you last wrote for television,” says Hannah, tartly. “I mean, honestly, whole species have evolved.”Some of that evolution has pushed sitcoms away from the live-audience multicamera style, the province of a studio comedy like “Step Right Up,” to more visually sophisticated single-camera formats. The move from network to streaming, a move that “Reboot” explores, has wrought other changes. This new “Step Right Up” no longer need to adhere to a 22-minute format with A, B and C story lines and pauses for commercial breaks. More sexually explicit material is now permissible, as are obscenities.“It’s the world of sitcom, but it’s streaming,” Reiser said in an interview, speaking of the move to streaming generally. “So you can say whatever you want, and you’re not going for the laugh, necessarily.”But old constraints die hard. Though “Step Right Up” has taken on a new look, most of the episodes of “Reboot” do still honor a three-act structure. And if the set-up-punchline, set-up-punchline form has given ground, A, B and C plots remain. “It’s inherent,” Levitan said. “It’s baked into my bones right now that shows will have a certain sense of structure and plot.”And yet, as “Reboot” demonstrates, and as a rewatch of most ’80s, ’90s and ’00s comedies will prove, content has changed. Jokes that punched down at women, queer people, disabled people, and people of color rarely make it to air now. Levitan framed this as a limitation, if a good one.“The whole #MeToo, woke culture, it has changed where you can go, and by and large, in a positive way,” he said. “Where it gets tricky is when everybody is so scared of offending somebody that you don’t even go anywhere near the line anymore.”Bloom, who cocreated the sitcom “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” sees this new sensibility as an opportunity rather than a curb or a cause for angst. “There’s a mindfulness that’s being asked of people now that wasn’t being asked of people before,” she said. “I think it’s making us all better people, better comedians.” And she enjoys playing Hannah, even in her occasional humorlessness.“A girl who wears baggy sweaters with anxiety?” Bloom said. “I know that person.” Reiser, who described himself as “a little bit more aware than Gordon” agreed with his co-star. “I never understand people who say, ‘You couldn’t make that joke anymore,’” he said. “I go, ‘Why would you want to? How much do you want to make a joke?’ It’s kind of not cool and insensitive.”Some of the strongest scenes of “Reboot” are the ones set in the writers’ room that dramatize this tension. The writers whom Hannah has hired — a queer man and two women of color — clash openly with the older Jewish writers of Gordon’s acquaintance. In one scene, a younger writer critiques a joke pitched by the TV veteran Selma (Rose Abdoo, the series’s stealth M.V.P.).“I thought gay people were supposed to be fun,” Selma snaps back. But eventually they find a joke everyone likes. It involves a pratfall. Pratfalls are funny no matter what.But “Reboot” isn’t only funny. There’s a persistent sweetness to it and a sense that people can change, usually for the better.“That’s something that’s quite thrilling about the show,” said Keegan-Michael Key, a “Step Right Up” star. “It’s a Steve Levitan hallmark, isn’t it, that sense of people being open?”“Step Right Up” is the reboot at the center, but nearly all of the characters are rebooting themselves in one way or another, recovering from divorce, addiction, regional theater. Levitan mentioned how fans had told him how “Modern Family” had helped them work through difficult moments in their own lives. He hopes that “Reboot,” a show about Hollywood elites with Bentleys and real estate portfolios and connections to Nordic royalty, can do the same.“Bringing a little laughter into people’s lives is a really joyous thing to do,” he said.“Reboot” remains agnostic on the question of the worth of reboots themselves. Many real-world ones seem like little more than cheap intellectual-property grabs, and few improve on the original. Some are so dismal that they actually poison their predecessors, retroactively. The creators and stars of “Reboot” had varying opinions on the form. Or no opinion at all.“I don’t think that’s for me to say,” Levitan said. “Yeah, I would rather not draw the ire of comedy writers.” Reiser survived the reboot of “Mad About You” pretty much intact and seemed optimistic about the form. Bloom was less so.“The most exciting part of a reboot for me is the headline of a reboot coming up,” she said. The reboot itself was usually a disappointment.Key sounded more hopeful. He thought that reboots might work, at least notionally, and could even be innovative if the animating idea were persuasive enough. “I really think that is possible,” he said. “It’s all about angles.”Until Hollywood figures out those angles, we’ll just have to make do with something original. Like “Reboot.”</body>

	<title>Food Supply Disruption Is Another Front for Russian Falsehoods</title>
	<author>Jeremy W. Peters</author>
	<body>When the Dutch government announced plans in June to reduce certain greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 70 percent, farmers erupted in protest. The change requires sharply cutting the waste produced by livestock operations, potentially forcing some of them out of business. They clogged traffic on highways with their tractors, dumped manure in the streets and set bales of hay on fire.The demonstrations were covered extensively by the conservative news media in the United States, with outlets like Breitbart and Fox News describing how the farmers were staging their own versions of this year’s “freedom convoys” of Canadian truckers who were opposed to mandates for coronavirus vaccines and other Covid-19 policies.But beneath the headlines, in some of the darkest corners of the internet, disinformation researchers and State Department officials who monitor online propaganda saw the Dutch protests as feeding a troubling new conspiracy theory: Western nations are trying to impose mass hunger, and induce submission, by restricting and hoarding the world’s food supply. And the new environmental regulations in the Netherlands, according to the conspiracy theorists, are part of a wider plot by liberal policymakers to use climate change as a ruse to seize control of the farming industry.Most versions of this disinformation campaign implicate “globalists,” a term that antisemites online often use as shorthand for Jews. Other versions link it to a supposed plot by environmentalists to force people to eat insects instead of meat, a strain of misinformation that has been gaining traction on the far right in recent months.Disinformation experts agree that there is a main driver for these falsehoods: Russia. Propaganda from the Kremlin, they said, has bled into right-wing social media chat rooms and, occasionally, into mainstream conservative news media like Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program.U.S. officials have said Russia is trying to deflect its responsibility for disrupting the world food supply through its invasion of Ukraine. And they warn that these conspiracy theories will only find a more receptive audience as Russia’s invasion continues to pressure the global markets for food and energy and, as is expected, keeps prices elevated through the winter.Most troubling, some experts said, is how the spread of lies about food insecurity can be even more radicalizing than some of the most insidious conspiracy theories circulating about vaccines, voter fraud and a “deep state” of evil bureaucrats.“When it comes to the food supply, the conspiracies become existential,” said Joel Finkelstein, co-founder of the Network Contagion Research Institute, which tracks hate and extremism on social media. “If you lose an election, you can win it back. Vaccines, well, you’re going to get sick, but you’ll be OK, probably.”“But when it comes to food,” Mr. Finkelstein continued, “it becomes a matter of selecting who lives and who dies. And the threat of political violence becomes completely justified in the minds of certain people.”Throughout the summer, the Network Contagion Research Institute noticed a spike in extremist activity related to the Dutch protests on Twitter, Telegram and 4chan, the message board on which conspiracy theories spread largely unchecked. In a report, the institute said many of the people spreading false reports of an intentional manipulation of the food supply were devotees of QAnon, the fringe movement that believes a cabal of child traffickers runs the world.In a post cited in the report, one QAnon supporter who has more than 250,000 followers on Telegram wrote: “Never believe for one moment there’s a shortage of anything. Food. Water. Oil. They create and manufacture these shortages.”The report noted that the use of “they” in many of these conspiracies “is typically code for ‘the elites,’ and in some cases, the Jewish community.”Sometimes, these ideas find their way to more mainstream outlets.In July, Mr. Carlson hosted a right-wing Dutch philosopher on his show to discuss the uprising in the Netherlands. “Messing with the food supply tends to cause food crises, and then famine,” Mr. Carlson told his audience in a segment that presented the farmers as heroic. “You’re seeing this in the developing world thanks to climate activism and the war in Ukraine.”Mr. Carlson added, “We should be worried with the big things. And the food supply is the biggest thing.”Leah Bray, the acting coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, a division of the State Department that tracks misinformation and disinformation, said that both in peacetime and now in wartime Russia had used “information manipulation as a weapon to bring about its desired political ends.”These efforts, the center said in a recent report, have so far been concentrated in the Middle East and Africa, where food shortages have been most acutely felt. And, the report added, the conspiracy theories have spread through Kremlin-controlled state outlets such as RT Arabic and RT en Français, as well as through Chinese state media.Ms. Bray said she was especially concerned that Russia would manipulate similar emotions this winter, when energy insecurity is almost certain to increase. The intent of the Russians, she added, is to pit Western nations against one another in a blame game over who is responsible for the shortages.“Russia is going to use these tactics more broadly to seek to erode Western unity,” Ms. Bray said.With the invasion of Ukraine causing an energy crisis across Europe, the European Union has proposed mandatory electricity cuts, among other measures.If these ideas have been rather slow to take hold in the United States, that should not be seen as a sign that they won’t soon expand their reach, experts warned.“There was a long lag with QAnon, too,” said Denver Riggleman, a former intelligence consultant and a staff member for the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol who has worked with the Network Contagion Research Institute. “Then all of a sudden — boom. And that’s what I think we’re looking at here.”</body>

	<title>You Cannot Be Too Cynical About Trump (or His Imitators)</title>
	<author>Bret Stephens</author>
	<body>Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. Any plans to hop a flight to Martha’s Vineyard?Gail Collins: Gee, Bret, I think the Vineyard folks have had enough unexpected guests for a while. But I really was impressed by how gracious they were to the immigrant families that Gov. Ron DeSantis shipped there.Bret: It’s a shame for the Venezuelan migrants that they weren’t on the Vineyard for long, because the community there is extraordinarily generous.Gail: As opposed to DeSantis and his slimy attempt to score political points with the right wing.Bret: It was definitely a stunt, but it was a politically effective one.Gail: Are you still open to the idea of him as a possible president?Bret: All depends on the opponent. If you were a Republican primary voter and your choice was between Donald Trump and DeSantis, who would you choose? No fair to answer “Canada” or “euthanasia.”Gail: Exactly why I’m never going to be a Republican primary voter. And I don’t believe there’s a Democrat with an infinitesimal possibility of nomination I wouldn’t prefer to DeSantis.Bret: No fair avoiding the question! I’m no longer a registered Republican, but I’d root for DeSantis over Trump in a primary, and I’d vote for DeSantis over, say, Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom in a general election, though I hope that’s not the choice I would have to make. I’d also love to see a candidate who believes we need more immigrants in this country and is serious about effective border enforcement.Gail: About immigration. The Republicans are clearly planning to make that a big issue — certainly Trump loves to howl about it. But let me begin with one bottom line: The United States has an aging population that can’t possibly fill all the job openings it already has. The hospitality sector has been, on average, half a million people short every month for months; the food services industry alone is around 1.4 million people short.Bret: Total agreement on this one. We don’t just need immigrants to fill jobs — we also need their ambition, entrepreneurialism, work ethic, cultural creativity, strong family values and non-entitled attitudes. Unfortunately the Biden administration is screwing this up by pretending that we aren’t seeing a tidal wave of border migrants, and that it’s not a massive burden on the social services of border states.Mystifying to me why the administration can’t get this one right. Democrats are even losing Hispanic voters over the issue. What gives?Gail: No modern president has been able to get a real grip on the border immigration crisis — don’t even know if you can call it a crisis since it’s been going on for so long.Bret: There’s never been perfect border control, but there’s been better and worse. What we now have is unmistakably worse and a lot of liberals are deluding themselves if they think there’s nothing amiss when U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports a 250 percent increase in migrant encounters around Yuma.Gail: You have waves of folks fleeing from disaster back home — these days, particularly Venezuelans.Bret: Ah yes, Venezuela. Chesa Boudin’s idea of a workers’ paradise. Sorry, go on ….Gail: Many of them have endured terrible treks by foot, sometimes with children. If they present themselves at the border, their claims have to be processed, which can take a lot of time. The procedure is really a mess, and meanwhile there’s the choice between letting them live miserably in makeshift camps or providing them, and especially their children, with the services they need.Like his predecessors, Biden has been trying to get the system improved, but the legal issues plus the politics make it almost impossible.If these folks make their way into the country illegally, with luck they’ll get settled and work out their immigration problems later. But of course they can also wind up homeless and drift into crime. The border state residents have to bear most of the burden just because of their location, so you can see why they’d resent that.Bret: We obviously should be compassionate to refugees fleeing persecution, kids especially. But Biden has also turned the United States into a magnet for migration in a way that communities are simply unprepared to handle. Our compassion as a country has to be proportionate to our means, not our wishes.Gail: One thing we clearly need is revised immigration law that takes all this into consideration and provides economic support to the communities where these folks wind up. But I’ve noticed a certain lack of enthusiasm among congressional Republicans for that idea.Bret: There used to be Republicans — Ronald Reagan, both Presidents Bush, and John McCain among them — who were eager to pass comprehensive immigration reform and were stymied by restrictionists on both sides of the aisle, including Bernie Sanders. Now we’ve got an immigration debate in Congress that might as well be described as the heartless against the clueless.Switching subjects, Gail, our colleague David Brooks had a terrific column last week on why all the attempts to defeat Trump thus far have failed. Any theories of your own?Gail: Trump’s recent triumphs have been pretty much within his own party. Let’s see what happens when the candidates he endorsed for Senate, like that crazy guy in Arizona, actually have to run in an election against a non-crazy Democrat like Mark Kelly.Bret: Don’t be shocked if the crazy guy wins. Last poll I checked had him within two points.Gail: But in the bigger picture, we’re living in a new internet-oriented world where old political virtues like making reasonable deals with the other side have been wiped away. Too boring.Bret: Trump intuitively understands entertainment the way no other politician has since maybe Ronald Reagan. But Reagan was a romantic whereas Trump is a cynic, which makes him particularly potent in a cynical age.Gail: It’s scary how well Trump fits into that new world. No real ideas maybe, but he’s colorful, a good ranter and not constrained by any sense of obligation to be rational. Have to admit my greatest hope for the total scuttling of Trump’s political career is the New York attorney general’s attempt to pull the cover off his finances.How about you?Bret: I tend to think that all of these legal attacks on Trump do more to help than hurt him. He’s a Nietzschean figure in that sense: that which does not kill him makes him stronger. Unless he is tried in a courtroom somewhere in the West Village, there is no jury in the United States that is going to hand down a unanimous verdict against him. What these potential prosecutions mainly do is keep him in the spotlight, which is right where he likes to be, with something like the color of martyrdom, at least to his supporters.Gail: My dream has never been Trump behind bars — you’re right, he’d become a triple martyr — but Trump in bankruptcy court and then sending out Truth Social memes from a motel in New Jersey? That speaks to me.But go on …Bret: Trump is what a friend of mine calls a “rage funnel.” It’s a funnel for a very specific type of rage — the rage of feeling looked down upon. And I don’t think that ends until the culture of liberal condescension that people like Hillary Clinton typified turns into a culture of understanding and empathy for his voters.Gail: Hillary was over-blamed on that front, thanks to one dumb comment. But you’ve got a very important point and from now on when I see The Donald I’m going to see him as a funnel-head.Bret: Coneheads!Gail: On a totally different subject — you’re my trusted interpreter of sane Republicanism. Can you interpret what Lindsey Graham is up to with his bill creating a national ban on abortion? At a time when many of the G.O.P. Senate candidates seem to be scrubbing all abortion references off their websites?Bret: You can’t interpret stupid, Gail.The bill isn’t just dead on arrival with every single Democrat. It’s D.O.A. for many Republicans, too. The whole point of overturning Roe v. Wade was to let the states decide for themselves what limits to set on abortion. So much for federalism. And, as you point out, the proposal just plays into Democratic hands at a time when pro-choice voters are exceptionally motivated to go to the polls.Gail: Yippee!Bret: That being said, it isn’t such a bad thing that the G.O.P. keeps fumbling the politics of the midterm, because the last thing the country needs is yet another crop of Trumpy Republicans in Congress. So I say, go Lindsey!Gail: Wow, so you’re hoping for a Democratic-controlled Congress as well as a Democratic-controlled White House?Bret: Which Bolshevik was the one who said, “the worse, the better”? That’s kind of my attitude here. It’s not that I relish the idea of continued Democratic control. Far from it.

	<title>Chamath Palihapitiya, a ‘SPAC King,’ Will Wind Down Two Funds</title>
	<author>Michael J. de la Merced</author>
	<body>Over the past three years, Chamath Palihapitiya refashioned himself from venture capitalist to mogul in the world of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACS, the once-obscure financial vehicles also known as blank-check funds that rocketed in popularity — and stock market value — during the pandemic.Mr. Palihapitiya is now making a partial retreat.The investor announced on his blog on Tuesday that his firm, Social Capital, was winding down two of the SPACs it had co-created, and would return the money they had raised to investors. Together, the two funds oversee roughly $1.6 billion.The announcement by Mr. Palihapitiya, the financier once known as the “SPAC king,” is the latest sign of how far out of love Wall Street has fallen with blank-check funds.SPACs are publicly traded shell companies created solely to raise money via initial public offerings and merge with a privately held company, effectively taking them public. Such funds became a popular route to take start-ups public without the heavy regulation and drawn-out legal process of a traditional initial public offering. They raised billions of dollars from public-market investors — and reaped rewards for the vehicles’ creators, who typically get a 20 percent stake in the funds for a nominal investment. SPACs became popular among retail investors, particularly during the boom in stock trading that powered the meme-stock frenzy and lifted the share prices of many blank-check funds.Financiers like Mr. Palihapitiya and Michael Klein, a veteran deal maker, began to sponsor stables of blank-check funds, and even celebrities like Jay-Z and Serena Williams jumped on the bandwagon. Wall Street rushed to cater to demand, dispatching investment banking teams to help SPACs go public and identify companies to merge with.But interest in SPACs has recently waned. SPACs raised more than $160 billion in public offerings last year, according to the database SPAC Research. So far this year, SPACs have raised about $13 billion. The largest-ever SPAC, a $4 billion vehicle created by the billionaire investor William A. Ackman, was wound down in July, returning its money to investors.Fear of rising inflation and recession has driven stock investors toward conservative assets and away from the risky, profitless companies that were the targets of many blank-check mergers. Poor market performance for many of those companies has also been a factor.And regulators, fearful of individual investors being taken advantage of, opened investigations into blank-check funds and proposed rules that could drastically reduce the money to be made from them.The reason Mr. Palihapitiya cited for unwinding the two funds, widely known by their stock tickers IPOD and IPOF, was that they could not fulfill their mission of finding suitable companies to buy ahead of a two-year deadline that SPACs commonly face to complete a merger.“Over the past two years, we evaluated more than 100 targets and while we came close to doing a deal several times, we ultimately walked away each time,” he wrote.Shutting them down also means that Mr. Palihapitiya will forfeit the money his firm spent creating those funds.In his post, Mr. Palihapitiya wrote that he remained proud of the six companies he had helped take public through SPACs, including the spaceflight company Virgin Galactic and the online lender SoFi. (Of them, only the medical technology company ProKidney is trading above its debut price.)And Mr. Palihapitiya said he was still looking for takeover targets for the two remaining funds in his “Bio 2.0” investing strategy, which comprises SPACs focused on biotechnology companies.But he also downplayed the importance of SPACs to his firm, Social Capital.“Our view on SPACs remains consistent since our first deal,” he wrote. “SPACs are just one of many tools in our toolkit.”</body>

	<title>In Recovery After Storm, Alaska Faces Hard Days Ahead</title>
	<author>Emily Schwing</author>
	<body>FAIRBANKS, Alaska — In the village of Golovin, 50 miles east of Nome, initial reports indicated that up to a dozen of the 48 houses there had been inundated with water.Some 250 miles south in Newtok, a third of the population of about 200 sought shelter in the local school.In the city of Kotzebue, in the state’s Northwest Arctic Borough, a region where the yearly low temperature can reach 52 degrees below zero, residents reported their flooded airport runway was also covered in debris.On Sunday, after the remnants of Typhoon Merbok pummeled western Alaska with storm surges and gusting winds, residents living along more than 1,000 miles of coastline — many of them in the state’s most vulnerable communities — faced varying degrees of flooding and infrastructure damage. And there were concerns about the long-term impact and how they would recover as the colder months approach.Across the region, “hub” communities like Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet, nearly 400 miles northwest of Anchorage, as well as the smaller, roadless villages connected by them, were still feeling the pain of inundated streets and homes, power outages and airport runways under water. Similar stories were playing out in at least a dozen other remote villages in Alaska, where the population is predominantly Indigenous.For many, the storm could not have come at a worse time. Mid-September is prime hunting season, and most rural residents rely on hunting to stock their freezers with moose and caribou for the winter.Reports of damaged and upturned fuel tanks were also concerning, because those tanks hold the diesel fuel that powers local generators and heats homes. The tanks also hold the gasoline that fuels vehicles used in the hunting for subsistence: four-wheelers, boats and snowmobiles.In some cases, cabins people use during the fishing season, as well as drying racks and smokehouses, have been destroyed.Melanie Bahnke, president of Kawerak, a Nome-based regional consortium that serves 20 federally recognized tribes in Alaska, drew a comparison for non-Alaskans.“Imagine if New York’s airport was completely wiped out and there was no other way in or out,” she said. She then added: “Imagine if you no longer had a way to get to the grocery store.”Ms. Bahnke on Sunday called on Gov. Mike Dunleavy to move beyond a state disaster declaration, which he issued on Saturday. She said a federal disaster declaration from the Biden administration would release the level of funds that may be required for reconstruction.The disaster recovery process in Alaska will be unlike anything that would play out in the Lower 48 states. “In areas where hurricanes happen, FEMA provides temporary structures,” said Rhonda Schneider, the director of Nome’s Community Center, which runs an emergency shelter and operates a homelessness prevention program. It would be impossible to transport mobile homes and temporary trailers to remote Alaska, where villages are serviceable only by air or barge.Just about every community affected by the storm was already facing a housing and infrastructure crisis. Ms. Schneider said that damage to housing across western Alaska will further stretch thin resources. On average, she said, the number of people living in a single 900-square-foot home in any village can be as high as 15.“We know we are about 500 homes short in our region,” she said. In winter, she said, Nome’s community center houses around 200 individuals in its shelter. Roughly 3,700 people live year-round in the city.Ms. Bahnke said damage from the storm could also affect medical care. Most communities have only a local clinic, so many residents have to fly to Anchorage to seek treatment, she said.The fall is also when barges stop delivering goods and supplies to Alaska’s coastal communities. During the summer months, barges from Seattle carry construction equipment and other supplies to roadless communities, but the season is short, in large part because fall storms make the Bering and Chukchi Seas difficult to navigate. Any immediate reconstruction efforts are likely to be hampered because the first signs of oncoming winter freeze are just weeks away.In a news conference Saturday night, Mr. Dunleavy said Alaska was a state that deals with natural disasters on a regular basis, and he expressed confidence in its response capabilities. However, he also cited a long list of federal agencies that will be required as recovery begins, including the U.S. military and FEMA.According to the state’s Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, phone conversations about recovery efforts would start Monday, only after community leaders had time to take stock of damage. Jeremy Zidek, a spokesman for the agency, said Mr. Dunleavy had not submitted a formal request for a federal disaster declaration. Later in the day, however, the governor said he was preparing to ask for that.Tara Sweeney, an Alaska Native, the term used to describe someone who is Indigenous to the state, who worked as the assistant secretary of Indian Affairs during the Trump administration, said Sunday any meaningful response also needs to include long-term planning.Ms. Sweeney, a former congressional candidate who now works as a consultant on Arctic development and policy, also said the recovery would need not just money from a disaster declaration but a deeper understanding from lawmakers of the issues facing affected Alaskans.“Unless your boots are on the ground and you take time to come and see it, there’s no level of empathy that can replace responsible decision making,” she said.</body>

	<title>Justice Dept. Charges 48 in Brazen Pandemic Aid Fraud in Minnesota</title>
	<author>David A. Fahrenthold</author>
	<body>MINNEAPOLIS — The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had charged 48 people with running a brazen fraud against anti-hunger programs in the coronavirus pandemic, stealing $240 million by billing the government for meals they did not serve to children who did not exist.The case, in Minnesota, is the largest fraud uncovered in any pandemic-relief program, prosecutors said, standing out even in a period when heavy federal spending and lax oversight allowed a spree of scams with few recent parallels.The Minnesota operation, prosecutors said, involved faked receipts for 125 million meals. At times, it was especially bold: One accused conspirator told the government he had fed 5,000 children a day in a second-story apartment.Other defendants in the case seemed to put minimal effort into disguising what they were doing, using the website listofrandomnames.com to create a fake list of children they could charge for feeding. Others used a number-generating program to produce ages for the children they were supposedly feeding, which led the ages to fluctuate wildly each time the group updated its list of those nonexistent children, court papers said.But their scheme — details of which were reported in The New York Times in March — still pulled in millions of dollars per week, prosecutors said in court papers, because government officials had relaxed oversight of the feeding program during the pandemic and because the other defendants had help from a trusted insider.That insider was Aimee Bock, the founder of a nonprofit group, Feeding Our Future, that the State of Minnesota relied on as a watchdog to stop fraud at feeding sites. But Ms. Bock did the opposite, the indictments said: When pandemic-relief programs flooded the programs with money, she exploited her position to bring in nearly 200 new feeding operations she knew were submitting fake or inflated invoices.Even when the government of Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, raised questions, Ms. Bock rebuffed them by filing a lawsuit and accusing state officials of discriminating against her group’s largely East African clientele.“In effect, Feeding Our Future operated a pay-to-play scheme in which individuals seeking to operate fraudulent sites under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future had to kick back a portion of their fraudulent proceeds,” one indictment said, according to a copy obtained by The Times.“The subjects in this case weren’t interested in feeding our future,” Michael Paul, a special agent for the F.B.I., said at a news conference on Tuesday, when the charges were announced. “They were interested in feeding their own gluttony.”The defendants were indicted on charges that included wire fraud, bribery involving federal programs and money laundering. Prosecutors said the conspirators laundered money by routing the funds they stole through a web of shell companies. Prosecutors initially announced charges against 47 people, then charged another Tuesday evening before she left using a one-way ticket to Ethiopia.The case is the largest brought by the Justice Department as it scrambles to address waves of fraud involving pandemic-era programs that sent billions of dollars of aid into the economy, often with few strings attached and little oversight.The Labor Department’s inspector general’s office has opened 39,000 investigations. At the Small Business Administration, about 50 agents have been sorting through two million potentially fraudulent loan applications. And while the sheer volume of cases all but ensures that some cases will go unaddressed, the prosecutions in Minnesota signal that the Justice Department is moving aggressively on others.The indictments said the defendants spent their money on real estate in the United States, Kenya and Turkey, as well as on cars and luxury goods. The Justice Department is seeking to seize many of those purchases, including more than 20 cars, more than 40 properties, guns, cryptocurrency and a Louis Vuitton duffel bag.Prosecutors said on Tuesday that many defendants had been arrested or had turned themselves in. They said some had left the country but declined to say how many.Ms. Bock pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon in federal court in Minneapolis and was released to await trial. Kenneth Udoibok, her lawyer, said afterward that “we still maintain that she was unaware of any fraudulent activities.”Prosecutors said that those indicted included Sharmarke Issa, the former chairman of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority, and Abdi Nur Salah, a former aide to Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, a Democrat. Both men were publicly connected to this case earlier in the year because of their ties to a property that prosecutors said was bought with stolen money.Also among the people indicted was a Feeding Our Future employee, Abdikerm Abdelahi Eidleh, who was accused of taking kickbacks from people involved in the scheme. Three of the 48 defendants — including another of the nonprofit’s employees, Hadith Yusuf Ahmed — were charged via “criminal information” rather than a grand jury indictment.The state blocked Feeding Our Future from receiving more aid money after the F.B.I. served search warrants in the case in January. The nonprofit group sought to dissolve at the time, but Attorney General Keith Ellison of Minnesota, a Democrat, blocked the move. Mr. Ellison asked a judge to supervise the group while he investigated whether it broke state charity laws. That investigation appears to be continuing.As described by prosecutors, the participants targeted two federal food-aid programs, which were administered through state governments. They were intended to feed children in after-school programs and summer camps. But when the pandemic hit, Congress rejiggered the programs to reach millions of children stuck at home, pouring in billions of dollars more and changing the rules to let families pick up meals to go.As funding went up, however, oversight went down: State officials, for instance, no longer had to check on feeding sites in person. That left one last line of defense: the so-called watchdog sponsors, like Feeding Our Future. Those nonprofit groups served as conduits for money, from the states to individual feeding sites, and they were supposed to be on guard against fraud.But the system also gave those watchdogs a reason not to bark: They could keep 10 to 15 percent of the money that flowed through them. In this case, the indictments said, Ms. Bock’s group kept the money flowing to increase its own cut.“The defendants exploited the Covid-19 pandemic — and the resulting program changes — to enrich themselves,” the indictments say.Feeding Our Future had started before the pandemic as a small sponsor overseeing $3.5 million in funding. It never had an accountant on staff and sometimes struggled with basic governance, even allowing its nonprofit status to expire for a time.But by 2021, Feeding Our Future was handling $197 million in annual funding.Under its umbrella, the indictments said, six different groups began to operate similar frauds. The conspirators would often register new companies or nonprofits, then quickly sign them up as feeding operations under the supervision of Feeding Our Future.Then, the indictments said, the new groups would soon report that they were feeding thousands of children per day — numbers that put them among the biggest feeding operations in the state — and began reaping thousands or millions of dollars in federal payments. In Minneapolis, for instance, a man named Guhaad Hashi Said told the state that he was serving 5,000 meals, twice a day, at a new facility called Advance Youth Athletic Development.The site he listed was an unlikely place for anyone to feed children en masse: The address was a second-story apartment.Mr. Said was one of those indicted; the indictment said he was paid $2.9 million out of federal money routed through the state and Feeding Our Future. But the indictment said that Mr. Said provided “only a fraction” of the meals he claimed. In an interview this year, Mr. Said said that he had never claimed to serve 5,000 meals a day in the first place.In other cases, prosecutors said, feeding sites submitted invoices that were suspiciously consistent, with thousands of children listed as attending, day after day with no variation.“No one got sick. No one missed a meal. No one was away,” said Andrew M. Luger, the U.S. attorney for Minnesota, whose prosecutors are handling the case. “Same children. Every single day. Every single week.”In 2020, Minnesota officials grew concerned by the speed at which Feeding Our Future was creating new distribution sites and began giving them more scrutiny.In November of that year, the nonprofit responded defiantly, filing a lawsuit that accused state officials of discrimination. The suit said the state was harming children by delaying the start of Feeding Our Future’s new operations. “Every day that goes by, hundreds of the state’s most vulnerable children are going without much-needed meals,” it said.Several of the sites where the state had sought to delay operations later became centers of fraud, according to the indictments.In response to Feeding Our Future’s lawsuit, a state court judge ruled that Minnesota had not taken the steps necessary to block the payments. After that, in April 2021, frustrated state officials turned to the F.B.I. — and continued paying Feeding Our Future and its partners while federal agents investigated.The state “moved quickly and repeatedly raised the issue to federal authorities until we were able to find someone who would take the troubling spending as seriously as we were,” said Kevin Burns, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Education, which handled the food-aid money.Republicans in the State Senate released a report this month, before the indictments were made public, accusing the state’s Education Department of “dereliction of duty” for failing to stop Feeding Our Future sooner.</body>

	<title>How to Hunt Like an Octopus</title>
	<author>Veronique Greenwood</author>
	<body>In its small glass aquarium, an octopus is coiled placidly in its den.Then, a crab falls into the tank.The octopus scrambles to fling itself over the crab, looking less like a finely honed killing machine than a toddler who’s spotted a cookie, engulfing its clawed prey in a cloud of suckered arms and legs.However, there’s order to this chaos of limbs, according to a paper published Tuesday in the journal Current Biology. Scientists who observed how the octopus hunts found that the creature almost always uses its second arm from the center to make a grab for prey, and when it needs backup, it’s the arms closest to that second appendage that they bring into play. The researchers also found that different prey are hunted with different tactics: Crabs get a move the scientists call “parachuting,” while shrimp, which are more skittish and sensitive to big movements, are snared with a stealthy limb.Octopuses seem to hunt more by feel than by sight. They are often found prospecting for crabs and other prey rather than chasing them.“They wander around the reef and they speculate by sticking their arms down holes,” said Trevor Wardill, a professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota who studies the vision of octopuses and other cephalopods and is an author of the new paper.But sometimes octopuses will see a tasty critter dashing by and make a grab for it. Dr. Wardill and Flavie Bidel, a postdoctoral researcher in his laboratory, were curious how this less-studied form of hunting worked, so they set up high-speed cameras around aquariums with octopuses and dropped live crabs and shrimp down a chute to see what the cephalopods did.Reviewing hundreds of videos of octopus-on-prey action, they identified a number of moves used again and again. There’s parachuting, for instance, where the octopus pounces, spreads the webbing between its limbs to contain the prey and uses its limbs to bring dinner into its mouth. There’s the snap-trap, where two groups of arms extend like a pincer around the prey.There was also a strange little maneuver that the octopuses deployed when they were faced with a shrimp, which the scientists called “waving.”If a shrimp senses movement in the water nearby, it will flick its tail and zoom away, in what Dr. Wardill calls a “ballistic, get-the-heck-out-of-here” move. In the videos, octopuses often snaked an arm out in front of them, waving it gently, before wrapping it tightly around a shrimp’s antennae and going in for the kill. He speculates that this wavelike movement could be a way of spoofing the shrimp’s sensors: To the shrimp, it might feel about the same as a piece of seaweed undulating nearby, thus concealing the octopus’s actions.The researchers were also interested to see that octopuses tended to use the second arm out from the midline of their body, on the side facing the prey, to lead an attack.“There must be a hierarchy in the brain of the octopus,” a way to control the order in which limbs move, Dr. Wardill said.Octopus limbs “are highly flexible to some really amazing level,” he added, capable of taking on nearly infinite arrangements and forms to a degree that may appear random.But each limb might have a specific role during a bout of hunting by sight, the study suggests. All that swirling might obscure, to the average viewer without a high-speed camera, a carefully choreographed response.To understand what’s going on within the brain and limbs of the octopus, the team would like to be able to record what happens in the animal’s nervous system as it leaps into action. Does the brain recruit arms in specific groupings or in a certain order? Does the octopus react differently in dim light?For Dr. Wardill, Dr. Bidel and their colleagues, the answers lie ahead, on the other side of experiments where myriad octopuses dance in a rain of snacks.</body>

	<title>The Single Best Guide to Decarbonization I’ve Heard</title>
	<author>‘The Ezra Klein Show’</author>
	<body>Produced by ‘The Ezra Klein Show’In August, Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which included $392 billion towards a new climate budget — the single largest investment in emissions reduction in U.S. history. The CHIPS and Science Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act bring that number up to around $450 billion. All of that spending is designed with one major objective in mind: to put the United States on a path to a decarbonized economy, with the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.Achieving that goal is perhaps the single most important challenge of our age. And so I wanted to dedicate a full episode to it. How big is the task of decarbonizing the U.S. economy? What do we actually need to do to get there? How does the I.R.A. help do that? And what are the biggest obstacles still standing in our way?[You can listen to this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]Jesse Jenkins is an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University and leads the Princeton ZERO Lab. He was a lead author of the Net Zero America report, the most comprehensive attempt to map out the different pathways to decarbonization I’ve seen. He also leads the REPEAT Project, which has done some of the most in-depth modeling of how the Inflation Reduction Act and other climate policies could affect emissions.As a result, this conversation ended up being the single clearest explanation I’ve heard of both the path to decarbonizing America and the impact the Biden administration’s climate bills could have on that effort. I learned a ton from this one, and I think you will too.You can listen to our whole conversation by following “The Ezra Klein Show” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.

	<title>‘Serial’: Season 2</title>
	<author>Serial Productions</author>
	<body>In May 2014, a U.S. Special Operations team in a Black Hawk helicopter landed in the hills of Afghanistan. Waiting for them were more than a dozen Taliban fighters and a tall American, who looked pale and out of sorts: Bowe Bergdahl. Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier, had been a prisoner of the Taliban for nearly five years, and now he was going home.President Obama announced Bergdahl’s return in the Rose Garden, with the soldier’s parents at his side. Bergdahl’s hometown of Hailey, Idaho, planned a big celebration to welcome him back. But then, within days — within hours of his rescue, in fact — public reaction to his return flipped. People started saying Bergdahl shouldn’t be celebrated. Some of the soldiers from his unit called him a deserter, a traitor. They said he had deliberately walked off their small outpost in eastern Afghanistan and into hostile territory.Hailey canceled its celebration. The army launched an investigation. Then, in March, the military charged Bergdahl with two crimes, one of which carries the possibility of a life sentence. Through all of this, Bergdahl has been quiet. He hasn’t spoken to the press or done any interviews on TV. He has been like a ghost at the center of a raucous fight.Now, in Season 2, we get to hear what he has to say.Twenty minutes after then-Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl had walked away from his remote Army outpost in Afghanistan in the middle of a summer night, carrying little more than vacuum-packed chicken, knives, water and a compass, he began to realize just how dire his predicament was.“I’m going, ‘Good grief, I’m in over my head,’” Bergdahl said.“Suddenly, it really starts to sink in that I really did something bad,” he continued. “Or, not bad, but I really did something serious.”On the move with Bergdahl, the Taliban slipped past the U.S. Army’s effort to find him. During those days and weeks, both sides were asking, what is he worth to us?Bergdahl recounted his experience publicly for the first time in the first episode of this season of “Serial.” In interviews with the screenwriter Mark Boal, Bergdahl explained in his own words why he had left his base in June 2009, an action that prompted a manhunt involving thousands of soldiers and led him to spend nearly five years in captivity under the Taliban.Bergdahl’s first year in captivity started and ended with an escape.In between, he learned twisted lessons of survival, like how to smile when in agony. Another was if you ask for something, such as water, you’re likely to get less of it. He learned that the more disgusting he was — the worse he smelled, for example — the less his captors wanted to come near him, which meant opportunities to squirrel things away in bedclothes. He learned that if he made himself smaller and meeker, the Taliban were more likely to leave him alone.Perhaps the hardest lesson of all? As painful as it is to be forgotten, ultimately, that’s what you want.For about four years, Bowe Bergdahl was often confined to a collapsible metal cage. When the Taliban moved him to a new location, they’d rebuild the cage in whatever room they put him in, bolting and padlocking it together.As a result, Bergdahl’s descriptions from that period were limited by his obscured view inside a cage within a room. But what was happening outside?When Bowe Bergdahl went missing, a sprawling network — official and otherwise — sprang into action to get him back.His circumstances, as a U.S. prisoner of war being held in the friendly nation of Pakistan by a designated terrorist group, on behalf of the lawful combatants of the Taliban, presented a tangled knot of challenges that roped in a wide variety of actors.There was no handbook for a case like this.Gen. Kenneth Dahl was in charge of investigating and writing a report for the U.S. Army about Bergdahl’s decision to leave his post. Bergdahl gave his statement to General Dahl over a day and a half, nearly 380 pages long.In this and the next episode, Sarah Koenig zooms in on the experience as Bergdahl described it, bringing two important questions into focus: Did Bergdahl tell the truth about what he did? And, separately, was there truth in what he said?When Bergdahl finally sat down for an interview with General Dahl, he didn’t just go back to before his deployment to explain what had happened once he got to Afghanistan. He went all the way back — to home, Idaho and his childhood.Locked in captivity, Bergdahl filled the void that surrounded him with complicated thoughts.There were unanswered questions before Bergdahl became an Army soldier. He was separated from the U.S. Coast Guard in 2006 after he had become overwhelmed and experienced a breakdown during basic training.The Army, in order to enlist him two years later, would have had to waive its usual standards, which it did. But did the Army recruiting process work as it was supposed to?There was supposed to be something much greater at play in the negotiation of Bergdahl’s release from the Taliban. For a while, the United States saw it as part of a grand plan to end a war — but that is not what happened.With expectations so big, how did a prisoner swap become the only solution to getting Bergdahl home?The original plan for declaring Bergdahl’s successful rescue was simple: Release written statements from the president and the Pentagon.Instead, there was a Rose Garden announcement, with Bergdahl’s parents speaking — and then the national security adviser adding hasty words of praise on a Sunday morning news show the following day.But within days — within hours of his rescue, in fact — the public reaction to his return flipped.For some, it’s enough to sum up Bergdahl’s case by merely stating that what he did was wrong. They say the Army shouldn’t have let him enlist in the first place. Others offer the notion that five years of captivity balanced the scales.But to a lot of people who served in Afghanistan, and their families, failing to consider the consequences of Bergdahl’s decision to walk off feels like papering over something important and painful. They want accountability.What exactly should Bergdahl be blamed for? And how does the United States weigh the heaviest moral charge against him: Did any American soldiers die while looking for him?When it launched in 2014, “Serial” became a global sensation that has been credited with launching the modern era of audio journalism.

	<title>For New Yorkers, 6 p.m. Is the New 8 p.m.</title>
	<author>Rachel Sugar</author>
	<body>I WAS EATING French fries at the Odeon when I noticed that a server had begun to repeatedly check in. “Oh,” I realized, “she needs the table back.” It was 6:22 p.m. The restaurant was full. Once, 11:40 p.m. had been “a little too early for Odeon,” according to “Bright Lights, Big City,” Jay McInerney’s 1984 chronicle of druggy downtown Manhattan, which featured the spot’s red neon marquee on its original paperback cover. “We sometimes didn’t get busy until, like, 8:30,” says Roya Shanks, the restaurant’s longtime maitre d’. But lately, she reports, there are “waves of people making 5 o’clock reservations” — unheard of just a few years ago. Farther uptown, at Danny Meyer’s Ci Siamo and Gramercy Tavern, “People sit down at 6:30, and our restaurant is full,” says Megan Sullivan, the director of operations for Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. “Eight o’clock is what was hot for New Yorkers,” adds Roni Mazumdar, a co-owner of Dhamaka, a difficult-to-reserve Indian restaurant on the Lower East Side. “Now, people email, ‘Can I come in for that 6:00 reservation?’”Post-pandemic New York, a late-dining city by American standards — locals generally eat later in cities throughout Europe and South America, of course — has fallen in line with places like Los Angeles or Austin, Texas, in embracing the joys of twilight dinner. These days, the boundaries between one’s professional and social lives have collapsed: Though this fall may bring an uptick in commuting, only 8 percent of Manhattan employees have been going into an office five days a week, according to a May survey from the Partnership for New York City. And when work is home and home is work, an early meal is one of the easiest ways to assert that the day has come to some kind of conclusion. Not that 5 p.m. is necessarily when people want to eat, says S. Margot Finn, a food studies lecturer at the University of Michigan; it’s just “when they want to be somewhere else.”In some ways, this shift was forced upon New Yorkers: The city’s Covid-19 curfews for eating and drinking establishments are long gone, but many restaurants have maintained truncated hours, whether because of staffing issues or customer demand. LittleMad, a NoMad French Korean spot, once remained open until 11 p.m. on weekends, but “the latest we were getting was a 9:30 — maybe a 9:45 because somebody was running late,” says its general manager, Thomas Dunn. (The restaurant now closes every day by 10.) And Mazumdar thinks these industry changes are here to stay — “We’re going to see this trend go on for at least the next half-decade, if not longer,” he says — another of the many small, perhaps trivial-seeming pandemic resets that may nonetheless affect how New York and cities like it function and do business forever.THE IDEA OF an 8 p.m. dinner is a recent U.S. development. Into the 19th century, the day’s main meal was taken around noon: Most Americans were farmers, working in or near the buildings where they lived and doing physical labor that started early in the morning, and thus were ravenous by midday. Supper was the evening meal, light and usually served cold — a function, as the American writer Abigail Carroll explains in “Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal” (2013), of how laborious the cooking of the era could be. During the Industrial Revolution, large numbers of middle-class Americans began commuting to factory and office jobs, which meant that, among other developments, the whole family was no longer necessarily home to eat together before noon. In the following decades, “just as the wealthy in the United States imitated aristocratic fashion, they tended to dine late” and have “chefs who cooked French food,” says Paul Freedman, a historian at Yale University. (This year, it seems, we’ve broken ranks further with those continental habits: When I asked Ed Thaw, the director of London’s Ellory Limited, whether the European capitals have also moved to earlier reservations, he said that, “thankfully,” everyone still wants to eat at 8 p.m. or beyond.)New York is a place singularly obsessed with reinventing its own rituals and power moves — and there’s nothing like sharing agnolotti with friends before dusk on a Tuesday to demonstrate you’re a master of your own universe. Indeed, the once-geriatric stigma of being an early bird is gone. Or perhaps everyone’s become more geriatric: prioritizing sleep and giving one’s body a few hours to digest before bed; intermittently fasting and trading cocktails for all those new low- or no-alcohol aperitifs. In that light, eating early is just another way to reject the corporate hegemony that once defined a capitalistic city. “You dress up head to toe, go to dinner and then go home and watch your HBO show and [are] asleep by 11,” says Anthony Geich, the maitre d’ at Sona, a gold-pillared Indian restaurant in the Flatiron district. “The pandemic pushed us all into early retirement.”</body>

	<title>Lots of Food Gets Tossed. These Apps Let You Buy It, Cheap.</title>
	<author>Clare Toeniskoetter</author>
	<body>Every Sunday at 2 p.m., Marisela Godinez, the owner of El Mesón Tequilería, a Mexican restaurant in Austin, Texas, used to fill a 12-gallon bucket, plus another half-bucket, with leftover food from the restaurant’s all-you-can-eat brunch buffet. “We threw out a lot of food,” she said.But a few months ago Ms. Godinez signed up to use an app called Too Good To Go. Now, 10 customers pick up “surprise bags” of her leftovers for $5.99 each, and she sends far fewer scraps to the landfill or compost.Around the country, apps that connect customers to businesses with leftover food have begun to spread. The concept is simple: Restaurants and grocery stores throw away huge amounts of food every day. Rather than trash it, apps like Too Good To Go and Flashfood help businesses sell it at a reduced price. They claim that the businesses and buyers are helping the environment because the food would otherwise become food waste, a big contributor to climate change.The apps, which make money by taking a portion of each sale, promote themselves with language that sounds more like a call to arms than a grocery list. “Fight against food waste,” reads the Flashfood description. The Too Good To Go promo calls users “food waste warriors.”Similar apps are popping up around the world. In Singapore, treatsure started selling leftovers from hotel buffets and recently began partnering with supermarkets. In Hong Kong, Phenix sells from bakeries, coffee shops and grab-and-go restaurants. Tabete follows a similar model in Japan.Food production itself is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for between a quarter and a third of global emissions. Each step of the process — growing, harvesting, moving, processing, packaging, storing and preparing food — releases carbon dioxide, methane and other planet-warming gases. When the food is wasted, so are all those emissions.In addition, once unused food reaches landfills, it decomposes and releases more methane.“We waste 35 to 40 percent of the food we produce,” said Emily Broad Leib, the director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. A lot of it is perfectly edible, but it can be costly for businesses to store, transport and donate or sell. “To the extent that all of these apps make it easier for businesses, I think that they’re net positive,” she said.Launched in Toronto about a half-decade ago, Flashfood now works with more than 1,400 supermarkets in the United States and Canada (although that remains only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of grocery stores overall) including large chains like Meijer, Giant and SpartanNash stores. It recently entered the New York City market at a Stop &amp; Shop store in the Bronx. When food is nearing its expiration date, rather than throwing it out, retailers can scan products into the Flashfood system to be sold at about half price. Customers can browse the items through the app, purchase them and pick them up at a local store. Flashfood takes a 25 percent cut.In Hammond, Ind., Jerry Wash, a retired railroad ticket agent, said he regularly looked to see what’s available at his local Meijer. “We wake up in the morning, you know, most people are checking their social media,” he said. “We’re checking Flashfood.”Mr. Wash said he and his wife, Jody, didn’t shop at the regular clearance sections of grocery stores, describing sale food as “bruised” and “bad.” More recently, he said, they’ve been planning meals around what’s available on the app.Josh Domingues, the company’s founder and chief executive, acknowledged that he had recreated the clearance rack on people’s phones, but he said the presentation was key. “This food is not segregated in the back corner, that, like, almost makes you feel smaller for going to pick through,” he said. Instead, blue, branded fridges sit in the front of grocery stores with signs encouraging people to help fight food waste.Too Good To Go has tried to gamify buying leftover food. In the United States, customers in 12 cities can browse restaurants and stores, then reserve “surprise bags” that typically cost about $4 to $6 and contain food that would have been originally priced at roughly three times that amount. The bags can be picked up at a certain time window. Too Good To Go takes $1.79 per bag and charges partners an annual fee of $89.Jennifer Rexrode, a tax analyst in Austin, heard about the app in May. “A friend of mine posted a picture of their food that they got from Too Good To Go from a local barbecue restaurant where they got a bunch of ribs,” she said. “And I’m like, I want a bunch of ribs! And so, I signed up.”She says the surprise element makes it feel like adult trick-or-treating. Highlights from the 76 bags she’s ordered include: Seven soggy tacos and a chicken sandwich that she crisped up in her air fryer ($3.99), two dozen extra large sausage kolaches she shared with her mechanic ($5.99) and seven separate orders of cupcakes, cinnamon rolls, cookies, croissants, pie and falafel ($3.99 to $4.99 each) that she picked up back-to-back on her birthday.“Consumers actually really enjoy it,” said Jamie Crummie, the company’s co-founder. Some users post videos of their hauls on TikTok, and there’s a Reddit community of over 10,000 people sharing photos of bags.Others take to Facebook to share their surprises. Kate Mytron in Portland posted a photo of four slices of pizza with the caption “Not the best pizza, but well worth the $5.” In New York City, Joel St. Germain put up photos of a bag of rotten produce. “There was nothing usable in it,” he said. “It all went in the garbage, a hundred percent.”Mr. St. Germain said he had recently cut down on using the app, but not because of occasional bad orders. It’s just that he was gaining weight from eating too much pizza and pastries.Too Good To Go is more popular in Europe, where it operates in 15 countries and has partnerships with international chains including Starbucks, Pret A Manger and Costa Coffee. In the United States, the company said it was continuing to expand and is currently piloting partnerships with Safeway and Panera.Several food waste experts expressed optimism that these types of apps could help limit the amount of food sent to landfills. And even though charitable organizations often redirect unwanted food from restaurants and grocery stores to food banks and community kitchens, “there’s space for all of these kinds of solutions to coexist,” said Lorenzo Macaluso, the chief growth officer at the Center for EcoTechnology, a nonprofit group that focuses on the issue. “Unfortunately, there’s way too much food waste out there.”Mr. Macaluso pointed out that these apps are geared toward selling small volumes of perishable goods, whereas food banks are usually set up to handle much larger donations. “So those kinds of apps are filling a really interesting and unique niche,” he said.The apps also have the potential to reach people facing food insecurity. Flashfood said a minority of its shoppers (roughly one in five) experience food insecurity, according to its own survey data, and the company is working to allow government assistance cards as payment methods. A spokeswoman for Too Good To Go said the company did not accept food stamps and did not have similar data on users.One complication is that, according to interviews with several companies selling on Too Good To Go, at least a few items for sale there aren’t necessarily what buyers might think of as “food waste.” The owner of a Baltimore dessert shop said she considered the app a promotional tool to reach new customers by selling what she called “little samples.” A beverage company owner said he used the app to sell discontinued products, but also sold new flavors there in hopes of attracting new customers.Mr. Crummie, the Too Good To Go director, said the app’s requisite price point dissuaded this type of behavior. “If somebody is paying $5, they should be receiving $15 worth of food,” he said. “So it’s not a profit-generating platform.” He added that the company responded to user reviews, and when businesses are misusing the platform, it ends the partnership.Regardless, Professor Broad Leib said she thought these apps would make users reconsider their own food waste, and that would be beneficial. “The best ways to change consumer behavior has been just making people more aware of the issues,” she said.Ms. Rexrode, the tax analyst in Austin who uses Too Good To Go, has thought about the effect she’s having on the climate. The app includes details on how many pounds of carbon dioxide she has “saved” based on the number of surprise bags she has bought, which in her case is 419 pounds.However, she pointed out, that number might not be entirely accurate. “They don’t know how much I’ve contributed by going to get the food,” Ms. Rexrode said. “I am driving!”</body>

	<title>Colin Hanks Finds Perfection in ‘What We Do in the Shadows’ and Tacos at Every Meal</title>
	<author>Kathryn Shattuck</author>
	<body>When Colin Hanks learned that he was being considered for “A Friend of the Family,” he thought, “Awesome — it sounds fabulous.”Then the scripts arrived.“I went, ‘Oh, this is just the saddest show I’ve ever read, so I don’t know what to think if you’ve been thinking of me,’” he recalled. “It was one of those stories that was incredibly intimidating and my first instinct was just, ‘No, I can’t.’”But he couldn’t get the true-crime show out of his head. Debuting Oct. 6 on Peacock, Nick Antosca’s limited series is based on the real story of the Brobergs (who were also the subjects of the 2017 Netflix documentary “Abducted in Plain Sight”).Hanks plays Bob Broberg, a stalwart Mormon in bucolic Idaho whose family implodes when Robert Berchtold (Jake Lacy) — or Brother B, to his adoring neighbors — moves to town and perverts everything they thought they believed in. He also kidnaps the Brobergs’ eldest daughter, Jan. Twice.Before he took on the role, Hanks made it clear that he wasn’t interested in re-enacting a laundry list of all the bad decisions the Brobergs made while being emotionally and sexually manipulated by Berchtold, even as they questioned his growing fixation on their daughter. Rather, Hanks wanted to examine why they made these choices.“And that was exactly what Nick was wanting to explore,” he said.It has been a hectic year for Hanks, who played an F.B.I. agent in “Impeachment: American Crime Story,” about the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, and a studio executive in “The Offer,” about the making of “The Godfather.” A San Francisco Giants fan, he has also produced a documentary about Willie Mays, out November on HBO.Calling from London, where he’s shooting an independent film, Hanks ticked off 10 things that have kept him grounded during the hustle, including “What We Do in the Shadows,” his cast-iron skillet and the Atlanta BeltLine.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.1. “The Baseball 100” by Joe Posnanski I’ve been slowly reading this book because I don’t want it to end. They’re really more of a character study on players from all different points in baseball’s history, as well as players from Japan and players from the Negro leagues.2. My cast-iron skillet I’m not very skilled at cooking, not yet at least. But there’s something about the idea of using this one skillet and seasoning it and being able to cook almost anything in it and that’s all you need. In a strange way, it’s also a little bit like a baseball mitt. You’ve got to break it in. You’ve got to take care of it. You’ve got to clean it properly. It’s not something that you use and then throw in the sink and don’t think twice about.3. “Sunderland ’Til I Die” on Netflix I’ve made a bunch of documentaries. That’s sort of my show business side hustle. I did one about Tower Records. I did another about Eagles of Death Metal going back to Paris, playing after the Bataclan attack. Recently, I got obsessed with this fantastic sports doc called “Sunderland ’Til I Die,” about an English football team that’s been demoted. That’s just heartbreak, the likes of which I’ve not seen in sports in quite some time.4. Shaving my head I had to have a very specific hairstyle to play Bob Broberg. So half of my head has been shaved because I had a very serious wig process that I had to go through. I had to paint my head every morning and then do four layers of makeup and then put a wig on top. I’ve been wearing a hat every day since. I’m currently doing a job in which I had to have another wig made that looks like my normal hairstyle. I’m very much looking forward to about seven days from now, being able to shave my head and start all over again.5. Tacos The perfect food. Period. Exclamation point. They can be lunch, they can be dinner and, if you’re really lucky and you’ve got a good spot, they can also be breakfast as well.6. Discovering “new” music I find something really joyful in discovering music that’s new for you but might not necessarily be new for all. I found this record by this band called Jagwar Ma from 2013, and I’ve been listening to it nonstop walking around London. Wherever I travel, I go to local record stores, and I will label what city I’ve bought the records in. And so all of my records are sort of a memory, if you will, of where I was literally, physically, but also where I was in my life and what I was doing.7. Fall Fall is one of those moments that I really enjoy — you see the leaves change and you feel the temperature drop and everyone gets excited, for a little while at least, to button up their coats. It also means that the Fall Classic is right around the corner.8. The Atlanta BeltLine I live in Los Angeles, but I had to relocate to Atlanta for “A Friend of the Family.” It’s this fantastic walkway that circles the entire city. It is just this incredible conduit to Atlanta. Since I was staying right by it, I could throw some shoes on and go for a walk and see people and have dinner someplace and walk back. It’s not too dissimilar from the High Line in New York. It made me feel like I was part of the life there.9. Soccer They call it the beautiful game for a reason. The simplicity of it — a sport that is played everywhere around the world, and all you really need is a ball. I was actually supposed to see Liverpool play and it was going to be the first time I was going to see them live in person, and the match was postponed because of the Queen’s funeral. So it was very, very sad. Hence, now a Sunday spent at a pub drinking my sorrows away.10. FX’s “What We Do in the Shadows” It’s one of those shows where you might watch the first two episodes and your instinct is to say, “OK, I get it. They’re vampires. It’s a fake documentary. Everyone is speaking in funny accents.” Pardon the pun, but that show crept up on me in such a way that I am crying laughing practically every single episode. The concept of a vampire that sucks your energy by boring you to death, I thought that was so hilarious. Oddly, you wouldn’t necessarily think that a show that broad would be able to grip you and make you fall in love with the characters. But I absolutely have.</body>

	<title>We Have Reached Peak ‘Mental Health’</title>
	<author>Huw Green</author>
	<body>A few months ago I received a referral for a new patient with a history of depression who’d made a serious suicide attempt. Perhaps unsure how to describe these episodes, the referring clinician wrote vaguely that the person had a “history of mental health.”Ordinarily, the word “health” implies an absence of illness. That is no longer how the term “mental health” gets used. The idea of mental illness, or mental disorder — both terms that have been subjected to their own intractable debates — has come to be supplanted by a broader umbrella notion, “mental health,” which somehow, confusingly, gets used to refer to states of both wellness and distress. Some awareness campaigners have even adopted the slogan “We all have mental health,” which seems on the face of it to be a stigma-busting, solidarity-building mantra. On closer examination, however, it manages a double exclusion. It fails to actually name any mental health problems — those about which we ought to be raising awareness — and it also makes a claim that is sadly untrue; there are many people who, at least some of the time, do not have mental health.We are talking more and more about our mental health, and this has been enormously positive. It is no longer unusual to see celebrities or politicians referencing the concept. The rise of social media has introduced a generation of clinicians who have been adept at using it to communicate. In the United States, Dr. Emily Anhalt produces elegant aphorisms and promotes the virtues of psychodynamic psychotherapy on Twitter. In Britain, Dr. Julie Smith has turned her well-crafted TikTok advice videos into a best-selling book of practical psychology.The focus of most of these discussions is improved mental health for all, rather than focusing on a particular group or condition. But language can be slippery.The term “mental health” is a euphemism, and euphemisms are what we use when we want to obscure something. This language — in contrast to “mental illness” — encourages us to focus on the regulation of more or less transient states, and on the maintenance of something we supposedly all have. “Mental health” conjures phenomena that are, more or less, relatable: anxiety and depression. But who is being excluded as a result? The change in language was supposed to address stigma. But it has simply moved our attention away from the very people who face the most stigma — those with diagnoses of schizophrenia, for example, or symptoms that do not allow ready participation in the mental health curriculum.This shift also cuts in another direction. An emphasis on health and equilibrium, with accompanying “advice” and “techniques” for self-regulation, has resulted in the term “mental health” undergoing a kind of mission creep: from providing increased awareness of specific difficulties to offering a broad set of prescriptions about how we should live.The way we talk about mental health as a motivator for so many of our activities risks becoming a substitute for more broadly grounded discussions of how we should act. Consider the relatively recent notion of a mental health day. We absolutely need to take days off work for our mental health sometimes, and it is important that employers recognize our needs. But people also need — deserve — days away from their work without justification. They should then be free to spend those days doing whatever they like. Is a day off less valid if it isn’t spent engaged in something that has been approved by one of the many websites that now offer mental health day advice?When mental health is given as a principal motivator for our choices, we are prioritizing our own experiences. As a result, there is less room for moral or ethical considerations for our behavior, and also less room for motivations that have to do with social, community or familial commitments, or doing something for its own sake. There are probably lots of things we should do in spite of our mental health: helping others, forming deep emotional ties that may then need to be painfully broken, becoming immersed in sometimes maddening, at times obsessive political or creative projects. These are choices that need deep rational, ethical and personal engagement.I work in a hospital with people who have experienced acquired brain injuries; it’s a setting that inescapably involves loss and despair. Although my professional life is organized around reducing suffering, and although I think some emotional experiences represent clear illnesses, I also understand that many forms of misery are bound up with the experience of being a person. Distressing or extreme states can at times be part of what makes for a life worth living. There are feelings that are unavoidable, purposeful or morally significant.The shift toward prioritizing mental health might be benign if it were only one way of reframing the question of what our priorities should be. But it comes with the imprimatur of clinical authority. As a result, therapists increasingly stray into a broader ethical arena while appearing to remain within their own zones of expertise.During an inpatient hospitalization, the writer James Mumford took part in a form of therapy called acceptance and commitment therapy, which emphasizes the subjectivity and personal significance of our values — the idea being that we can better create a more meaningful life if we focus on what is important to us. Perhaps. But Dr. Mumford, an ethicist, observed that his therapist seemed to slide too readily into implying that values are entirely subjective, that there are no moral facts. This is a theoretically substantive claim, one that is controversial among philosophers; Dr. Mumford tried to engage the therapist in discussion but was brushed off. Here was a situation in which mental health expertise came into conflict with philosophical reflection.The contemporary cultural landscape’s recent zeal for mental health as an important good has been accompanied by a faith in therapy as the best way to obtain it. Some, including Dr. Anhalt in a TED Talk, go so far as to propose that everyone should try therapy. Dr. Anhalt even suggested on Twitter recently that therapy become a prerequisite for becoming a parent. The tweet was enthusiastically embraced by some, though she received pushback from those who noted its cultural insensitivity and its resemblance to the eugenic idea of government-issued licenses for parenthood. In the end, Dr. Anhalt deleted the tweet.I have had therapy at various points in my life, including right now. Many more people would likely benefit from therapy than currently engage in it. Nonetheless, I feel more circumspect about the generality of the prescription. Therapy is important as a valuable health intervention for many, rather than a universal prerequisite to a good life. Most people simply cannot afford to have lengthy therapy, or it doesn’t fit with their cultural or religious worldview. Do we really want to suggest that this compromises their mental health or their ability to do things like parent well?The vagueness of the term “mental health” also means that it is ripe for cynical co-option. When, during the early stages of the pandemic, many Republicans opposed mask mandates in schools, the issue of masks’ effect on children’s mental health was a key talking point. Tucker Carlson specifically raised the issue in a lengthy anti-mask screed, the phrase lending a cheap veneer of clinical authority to his histrionics.It is insulting to hear platitudes about children’s mental health from a part of the political spectrum that routinely blocks serious action to stop school shootings. Conservatives do draw on mental health as a talking point in this context too, but here it used to draw attention away from the political and societal causes of gun violence. Instead of seeing internationally unparalleled access to guns as a relevant public health issue, we are encouraged to consider the mental health of the shooter. A clear causal link between psychiatric illness and gun violence has not been established, but the imprecision of the term “mental health” allows the argument to prosper. When, in the wake of the Uvalde shooting, Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, said, “Anybody who shoots somebody else has a mental health challenge, period,” he was saying something that was arguably true, but so trivial and imprecise as to be useless.As a psychologist, I am heartened by the increase in our attention on mental health. But I see it as one way of looking at our lives among others. Mental health professionals are understandably interested in mental health — but we need to remain interested in how people lead lives that are good, happy or meaningful without ever spending much time with clinicians. When we move away from a focus on psychological problems and toward “mental health” more broadly, clinicians stumble into terrain that extends beyond our expertise. We ought to be appropriately humble. We need to be mindful of the perennial difficulty of defining the boundary between sanity and madness, or of deciding what constitutes a good and valuable life.Huw Green (@Huwtube) is a clinical psychologist specializing in neuropsychology.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>‘Crippling’ Energy Bills Force Europe’s Factories to Go Dark</title>
	<author>Liz Alderman</author>
	<body>The furnace, heated to 1,500 degrees Celsius, was glowing red. Workers at the Arc International glass factory loaded it with sand that slowly pooled into a molten mass. Nearby on the factory floor, machines transformed the shapeless liquid with a blast of hot air into thousands of delicate wine glasses, destined for sale to restaurants and homes worldwide.Nicholas Hodler, the chief executive, surveyed the assembly line, shimmering blue with natural gas flames. For years, Arc had been powered by cheap energy that helped turn the company into the world’s largest producer of glass tableware — and a vital employer in this working-class region of northern France.But the impact of Russia’s abrupt cutoff of gas to Europe has doused the business with new risks. Energy prices have climbed so fast that Mr. Hodler has had to rewrite business forecasts six times in two months. Recently, he put a third of Arc’s 4,500 employees on partial furlough to save money. Four of the factory’s nine furnaces will be idled; the others will be switched from natural gas to diesel, a cheaper but more polluting fuel.“It’s the most dramatic situation we have ever encountered,” Mr. Hodler said, shouting to be heard over the din of clinking glasses. “For energy-intensive businesses like ours, it’s crippling.”Arc is not alone. High energy prices are lashing European industry, forcing factories to cut production quickly and put tens of thousands of employees on furlough. The cutbacks, though expected to be temporary, are raising the risks of a painful recession in Europe. Industrial production in the euro area fell 2.3 percent in July from a year earlier, the biggest drop in more than two years.Makers of metal, paper, fertilizer and other products that depend on gas and electricity to transform raw materials into products from car doors to cardboard boxes have announced belt-tightening. Half of Europe’s aluminum and zinc production has been taken offline, according to Eurometaux, Europe’s metals trade association.Among them is Arcelor Mittal, Europe’s largest steel maker, which is idling blast furnaces in Germany. Alcoa, a global aluminum products producer, is cutting a third of production at its smelter in Norway. In the Netherlands, Nyrstar, the world’s biggest zinc producer, is pausing output until further notice.Even toilet paper is not immune: In Germany, Hakle, one of the largest manufacturers, announced that it had tumbled into insolvency because of a “historic energy crisis.”The whirlwind has unnerved the inhabitants of Arques, a town whose fortunes have been tied to glassmaking for more than a century. The modern-day Arc was founded in 1825 as the Verrerie Cristallerie d’Arques, then a small local maker of fine crystal goblets.Today, Arc’s operations are enormous, spanning an area nearly half the size of New York’s Central Park. Its mass is such that Arc indirectly generates another 15,000 or so jobs in the region, from cardboard factories that package its glass to transport companies ferrying its products. Arc’s other factories are in China, Dubai and New Jersey.“The shutdown of the furnaces is bad news,” said one worker, a 28-year veteran of the factory, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of compromising his job. “Sure, high energy prices are having an impact,” he added, “but it’s scary how fast it's happening.”To some extent, the crisis is a blowback from European sanctions that were intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The pain has undermined confidence at European companies and their ability to plan.This past week, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed offsetting the hit by capping revenue from low-cost electricity generators and forcing fossil fuel firms to share the profit they make from soaring energy prices.But the solutions may not be fast enough. Costs have already soared beyond what many manufacturers can afford. Thousands of European companies are near the end of fixed energy contracts signed when prices were cheaper, and must renew them in October at current prices. Year-ahead electricity prices, which are tied to the cost of gas, are around 1,000 euros per megawatt-hour in Germany and France, while natural gas is at record highs of around €230 per megawatt-hour.What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source.Eschenbach Porcelain survived Germany’s transition from communism to capitalism after 1989. But when its energy contracts run out at the end of this year, the company will face annual energy bills of €5.5 million, or roughly six times what it is paying now, said Rolf Frowein, its director.“That would mean we have to more than double our prices, and nobody will pay that for our cups and plates,” he said. Eschenbach, a 130-year-old company in the eastern state of Thuringia, is in talks with local politicians about a potential solution. It is one of dozens of small and midsize firms in Germany fearing they will have to close for good.An hour north of the Arc factory, Aluminium Dunkerque, France’s biggest aluminum producer, will furlough part of its 620-person work force and cut production by more than 20 percent as it faces a potential fourfold jump in its energy costs.“The time we spend dealing with energy issues been multiplied by 10,” said Guillaume de Goÿs, the chief executive. “We hope the crisis will be short-lived, but if it lasts, European industry will be in very big trouble.”Mr. Hodler is laboring to steer Arc away from trouble, after years of financial difficulties linked to overexpansion and, more recently, pandemic lockdowns. In December, shortly after Mr. Hodler took over in a management shake-up, Arc received an emergency €45 million loan backed by the French state and is now asking the government for additional relief from high energy bills.The site, which consumes as much energy as 200,000 homes, makes “arts de table,” including Luminarc dinner plates and Cristal d’Arques-branded table and barware. All told, Arc produces four million glasses a day, as well as items like candle holders for Bath &amp; Body Works and promotional glasses for Heineken and McDonald’s.Doing so requires intense heat to melt sand into glass in furnaces that must stay lit 24 hours a day. In summer, Europe’s power crunch propelled Arc’s energy bill to $75 million, from 19 million euros a year ago. On top of that, consumers suddenly stopped buying items like candleholders and washing machines, for which Arc makes glass windows, sending orders plunging.“People are worried about their winter energy bills, and are saying, ‘I’ll wait to buy that nonessential item,’” Mr. Hodler said.The double-whammy sent Arc’s management team scrambling for solutions — all of them less than desirable.This month, 1,600 workers were asked to stay home two days a week to cut costs. And for the first time, Arc’s furnaces will switch to diesel power instead of natural gas, which is fed directly to the factory through a pipeline. The diesel will raise Arc’s carbon footprint by 30 percent, and must be delivered in huge quantities by tanker trucks.Even more daunting was the prospect of idling Arcs furnaces. “You can’t just shut down a glass furnace — it would destroy it,” Mr. Hodler said. “If they are powered down gently, they will survive, but then they take more than one month to be reheated.”Two furnaces that were planned for scheduled maintenance may now remain offline for the foreseeable future, Mr. Hodler said. Another two will be temporarily mothballed to make up for the fall in demand.“We don’t want to stop operations completely,” Mr. Hodler said. “But we are not going to produce if we lose money.”All of which has locals in Arques very worried. At Le Cristal, a cafe that is a hangout for Arc factory workers, the fate of the furnaces was all anybody talked about on a recent afternoon.“Arc is the lifeblood of this region,” said Valerie Harle, the owner of the cafe, which opened in 1939 and is named in honor of Georges Durand, who built the Cristallerie d’Arques from a small-time factory into an empire. “If the furnaces don’t work, neither do the employees.”Veronique Cognoti, a longtime resident, said locals were bracing for a domino effect. “A lot of other businesses depend on it,” she said of the factory. “Transport companies, cardboard box makers — they will all feel the blow.”At a nearby table, a man who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he was furloughed this month from his job at a nearby cardboard factory that makes boxes and packaging for Arc, after the glassmaker cut production.“With the price of energy as it is, the factory isn’t working as much as it used to, and it is already creating a chain reaction,” he said.He was being paid 80 percent of his salary to stay home while his factory was idled, but that had added up to €130 in lost pay. At the same time, he said, the gasoline bill to fill his small car had jumped to nearly €100, from about €50 at the beginning of the year.“This is going to become a much bigger problem,” he said.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.</body>

	<title>Egypt Feels Pain of Global Disruptions Wrought by War and Pandemic</title>
	<author>The New York Times</author>
	<body>When the state-owned factory where Hesham el-Atar worked for 15 years was liquidated this month, he had a feeling it was linked to international pressure on the Egyptian government to reduce its role in the economy amid a severe downturn.Mr. el-Atar, 39, was a supervisor at the factory, El Nasr Coke and Chemicals Plant, which turned coal into a fuel called coke used in iron and steel production. Now, with his daily expenses rising, he said that he fears he will not be able to find another job near his home in the city of El Saf, about two hours south of the Egyptian capital.“I don’t know what to do,” he said. “I have four kids. We’re used to a certain standard of living. It will have to change.”Egypt, which relies heavily on imported goods and foreign borrowing, has been badly battered by the cascading disruptions to global trade from the pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine. The exit of foreign investment capital, a collapse in tourism and spiking commodity prices have all translated into a foreign-currency shortage.The government has responded by implementing more onerous import rules, devaluing the local currency and pushing up interest rates. It has also taken steps to privatize or shut down state-owned enterprises, a key demand of international investors and creditors who say the government’s outsized role in the economy hinders private investment.But at the same time, Egypt has succeeded in raising more than $22 billion this year in investment pledges from wealthy Gulf allies leery of seeing one of the pillars of the Arab world on the brink after a decade of tumult that began with the country’s 2011 uprising.Consumers immediately felt the impact of the government’s response to the crisis, particularly Egypt’s middle class, which has been whittled away by a persistent lack of job opportunities, decreases in consumer subsidies, paltry spending on health and education and a regressive tax system that goes in no small part to fund grandiose infrastructure projects.The import rules introduced at the beginning of the year required companies to pay for goods up front through the national banking system. That left some imported goods stuck in the ports and created shortages, though the government has since taken steps to ease the problems.In March, the central bank devalued the currency by about 14 percent and prices shot up. Salaries, however, did not.“We have to pay European prices on Egyptian salaries,” said Mona Hosni, a 34-year-old Cairo resident. “Our salaries are not like Europeans!”Ms. Hosni works on one side of Cairo and studies on the other. With the rise in prices, she cannot afford to move out of her family home in the suburb of Helwan. So she spends about three hours a day driving her 2011 Nissan between home, school and work.A new car is out of the question.The roads she drives on are lined with new developments and billboards advertising luxury real estate, even as much of the country remains mired in poverty.In recent years, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has overseen a huge building boom, borrowing from abroad to fuel Cairo’s inexorable sprawl. The government is even erecting a new capital in the desert, not far from the current one, at a cost of some $59 billion.Samer Atallah, an economics professor at the American University in Cairo, said that the country had taken on tremendous debt — which is becoming more expensive by the day as interest rates rise — without investing in the kinds of things that could create more exports, more sustainable economic growth or steady government revenues.“Fundamentally, the economy was geared up for a crisis,” he said.The government has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund about a loan: Economists estimate that Egypt may need $15 billion over the next three years, though the government has said it will seek a smaller package. And Egypt is expected to devalue the currency even further soon.The government must balance the demands of investors — whose money could help alleviate the economic crisis — with the risks of implementing measures that could cause even more economic pain for its citizens.International lenders have urged Egypt to privatize more of its economy as one way to achieve more lasting economic growth. Much of the economy has long been controlled by the state through moribund government-owned companies.In the case of the El Nasr factory where Mr. el-Atar worked for 15 years, the government said that it had incurred a loss of about $1.5 million last year and had no possibility of modernizing or improving its financial standing. The factory, which began production in 1964, was emitting significant pollution, according to news reports and government documents.Mr. el-Atar is now a union representative negotiating a severance package for the workers but whatever deal is reached, the money surely won’t go far given the rising prices and currency devaluation.The military’s control over a range of businesses has stifled competition from the private sector in industries from concrete to pasta production by leaning on advantages such as free conscripted labor and exemptions from taxes and customs fees.Egypt has promised before to privatize without following through. But as the economy cratered this year, the government has shown signs of renewed resolve, starting to sell off or shut down several state-owned companies.Across Cairo, people from all walks have been forced to adjust their daily routines to adapt to the economic pressures.At an auto-repair shop in one suburb, two managers said that the cost of parts they need from Europe had shot up and that they were losing customers because of the higher prices. Business is half of what it was before the pandemic, they added.“We’re all struggling,” said Mostafa el-Gammal, the general manager. “It’s showing on everyone.”Though they haven’t laid anyone off, wages at the shop are stagnant.Mr. el-Gammal said that he tried to shield his four children from the economic decline. But he said he was taken aback when he went to buy two of them backpacks for the start of the school year and shelled out double what he had in the past.His colleague who manages the auto shop, 33-year-old Mohamed Farouk, said that he had transferred his 6-year-old son to a more affordable school near their home in Nasr City, another Cairo neighborhood.The government has also tried to increase revenue by raising fees for its services.Assem Memon, 39, runs AdMazad, a private business with 14 employees that collects data on billboards to sell to companies that want to optimize ad campaigns. He said the economic slowdown and devaluation have complicated his plans to expand outside Egypt.The government was creating headaches for employers, Mr. Memon said, including a new Ministry of Finance online portal that must be used for all business-to-business transactions. The aim is to allow the government to see every transaction.Some tax withholding practices were also changed, he added, reducing the cash he can keep on hand. While he understands the government is aiming to increase revenue, he said the approach could deter entrepreneurship.“It’s suffocating small businesses,” he said.Gamal Osman, 59, a warehouse worker in Tanta, a city about two hours north of Cairo, said he was also paying more in fees for basic services, like renewing his identification card. He said that he had cut back to eating meat only once every two weeks and that, still, he could not save money like he used to.“You can feel it in everything you do,” he said. “From the moment you step onto the street until the moment you go to sleep.”Still, others see opportunity in the hardship.Mohamed Ehab is a marketing director for an auto company that introduced Jetour, a Chinese brand, into the Egyptian market in 2020. Sales were booming last year, but the new import rules have snarled the business.The company stopped accepting orders months ago and is focusing on expanding service centers.Mr. Ehab said that there was still demand for a practical family car, even after prices shot up with the devaluation. The company’s lowest-priced car went up to $26,000 from about $18,000, largely because the importers have to pay China in dollars.But he is hopeful that the impasse will spur the government to offer incentives for auto companies to assemble their products inside Egypt, which could generate jobs and make cars more affordable.“It’s a difficult time, but I think it’s part of a bigger, good story,” he said. </body>

	<title>Bad Bunny Leads 2022 Latin Grammy Nominations With 10</title>
	<author>Ben Sisario</author>
	<body>Bad Bunny, the chart-topping Puerto Rican star, dominates the nominations for the 23rd annual Latin Grammy Awards, leading stars from across the spectrum of Latin music, like Shakira, Rosalía, Carlos Vives and Jorge Drexler.Bad Bunny, whose “Un Verano Sin Ti” is an international blockbuster — and the biggest LP of the year in the United States — has a total of 10 nods in seven categories, including album of the year, according to an announcement on Tuesday by the Latin Recording Academy, which has been presenting the awards since 2000. The Mexican songwriter and producer Edgar Barrera has nine, and both Rosalía, the genre-blending Spanish performer, and the Puerto Rican singer Rauw Alejandro follow with eight.Artists with seven nominations include Drexler, the doctor-turned-songwriter from Uruguay who first came to international attention in 2004 when he won an Academy Award for a song from the film “The Motorcycle Diaries,” and Christina Aguilera, the American pop diva behind hits like “Genie in a Bottle” and “Beautiful,” who released a Spanish-language album, “Aguilera,” this year.Camilo, a playful Colombian pop singer with a handlebar mustache, whose recent music has been documenting his domestic life, has six nods, as does Carlos Vives, a veteran singer-songwriter from Colombia with 15 Latin Grammys already.This year’s Latin Grammys will honor music released from June 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022. To be considered, songs must be new and contain lyrics in Spanish, Portuguese “or Indigenous dialects of our region, regardless of where such product was recorded or released,” according to a statement from the academy.In addition to album of the year, Bad Bunny — born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio — is nominated in the record of the year category for “Ojitos Lindos,” featuring the Colombian electronic duo Bomba Estéreo. “Un Verano” is also up for urban music album, and Bad Bunny’s other nods reflect his prolific work over the last year, solo and in collaboration.Bad Bunny competes against himself in the urban fusion/performance category (with “Tití Me Preguntó” from “Un Verano,” as well as “Volví,” a track with the New York bachata band Aventura); in reggaeton performance (two non-album tracks, “Lo Siento BB:/” with Tainy and Julieta Venegas, and “Yonaguni”); and in best urban song (“Tití Me Preguntó” and “Lo Siento”). Another non-album track, “De Museo,” is up for rap/hip-hop song.One surprise this year: a shutout for “Encanto,” the animated Disney film that came out in late 2021. Its songs, by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the composer behind “Hamilton,” draw from Latin styles including salsa and Colombian folk music, and tracks like “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” became ubiquitous hits. The soundtrack was eligible for awards, and was submitted for consideration, according to the academy, but it failed to get any nominations.In addition to “Un Verano,” the album of the year field includes “Aguilera”; Rosalía’s “Motomami”; Drexler’s “Tinta y Tiempo”; Bomba Estéreo’s “Deja”; Marc Anthony’s “Pa’lla Voy”; Alejandro Sanz’s “Sanz”; Fonseca’s “Viajante”; Sebastián Yatra’s “Dharma”; and Elsa y Elmar’s “Ya No Somos los Mismos.”Also up for record of the year are “Pa Mis Muchachas” by Aguilera, Becky G and Nicki Nicole, featuring Nathy Peluso; Rosalía’s “La Fama,” featuring the Weeknd; Anitta’s “Envolver”; Camilo’s “Pegao”; “Te Felicito” by Shakira and Alejandro; Pablo Alborán’s “Castillos de Arena”; Karol G’s “Provenza”; “Baloncito Viejo” by Vives and Camilo; Drexler’s “Tocarte,” with C. Tangana; Juan Luis Guerra’s “Vale la Pena”; and the title track of Anthony’s “Pa’lla Voy.”“Tocarte,” “Provenza,” “Pa Mis Muchachas” and “Baloncito Viejo” are also up for song of the year, a songwriter’s award. The other nominees in that category include Rosalía’s “Hentai”; “A Veces Bien y a Veces Mal,” as performed by Ricky Martin and Reik; “Agua,” performed by Daddy Yankee, Alejandro and Nile Rodgers; Mon Laferte’s “Algo Es Mejor”; Fonseca’s “Besos en la Frente”; Carla Morrison’s “Encontrarme”; Yatra’s “Tacones Rojos”; and “Índigo,” as performed by Camilo and Evaluna Montaner.The nominees for best new artist are Angela Álvarez, Sofía Campos, Cande y Paulo, Clarissa, Silvana Estrada, Pol Granch, Nabález, Tiare, Vale, Yahritza y Su Esencia and Nicole Zignago.Tainy, who worked on both Rosalía and Bad Bunny’s albums, is competing for producer of the year against Barrera (Camilo, Maluma), Eduardo Cabra (Elsa y Elmar, Mima), Nico Cotton (Conociendo Rusia, Elsa y Elmar) and Julio Reyes Copello (Fonseca, Cami &amp; Art House).The awards are voted on by members of the Latin Recording Academy, which include artists, songwriters, producers and other music creators in all genres. The ceremony will be held on Nov. 17 in Las Vegas.A complete list of nominees in all 53 categories is here.</body>

	<title>The Enduring Wisdom of ‘Goodnight Moon’</title>
	<author>Elisabeth Egan</author>
	<body>The first 25 times I read “Goodnight Moon,” I cried. Not in a dainty, tear-dabbing way; I’m talking Niagara waterworks, heaving sobs and a red nose.My firstborn daughter was only a few days old, swaddled in a blanket printed with baleful teddy bears, when we made our first foray into the iconic picture book by Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd. I’d been a mother for long enough to know how little I knew: My bathing and feeding skills were weak. My diapering experience was limited to Cabbage Patch Kids. The one-handed stroller collapse that would become my signature maneuver was a mirage shimmering beyond a desert of sleepless nights.Reading was something I could do with aplomb, and I thought the experience would be soothing for all involved — including my husband, who was sweating over instructions for a bottle sterilizer that looked like R2-D2. I picked “Goodnight Moon” because I remembered how veteran parents had slapped their hands over their hearts when I unwrapped the slim hardcover at my baby shower. The vote was unanimous: “That one is the best.”Except it wasn’t. The book was maudlin and depressing. It lacked the wild abandon of “Jamberry” and the wacky nonsense of “There’s a Wocket in My Pocket!” The lone red balloon made me feel like I was staring down a well, and the font reminded me of a standardized test. Plus, “Goodnight nobody?” It was a knife to the heart. By the time I arrived at “Goodnight noises everywhere,” I was mopping my face with the teddy bear blanket.For the uninitiated, “Goodnight Moon” tells the story of a rabbit getting ready for bed, bidding adieu to a series of items in his bedroom: a little toy house and a young mouse, “a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush and a quiet old lady who was whispering ‘hush.’”That lady, a mature-looking bunny, sits in a yellow rocking chair, knitting (garter-stitch, nothing fancy) while the little guy makes his rounds. Was she his mother? Grandmother? Babysitter? How could she just sit there? Shouldn’t she hug the little bunny, soothe him, assure him that she was there for him? He looks so sad, clutching his knees, marooned in a too-big bed. Then she exits the room, leaving him in the dark with nary a backward glance. Unconscionable!My husband quietly lifted our daughter out of my arms, his face arranged in the patient expression he wore while helping his grandmother into a minivan.Around the time my daughter started preschool, I started to develop a grudging respect for “Goodnight Moon.” It takes two minutes to read, depending on the frequency of your audience’s interruptions to request an extension on bedtime. There are no flaps to lift, sound effects to approximate or thought bubbles to explain. The book has a pleasing, economical feel, like a mug with the perfect handle.I appreciated that the bunnies don’t have their own shows, movies and theme parks. You won’t find them on boxes of Band-Aids or tubes of toothpaste. They aren’t as melancholy as the Velveteen Rabbit or as cheeky as Peter; they aren’t anodyne like Pat, sinister like Bunnicula or inscrutable like Miffy. I still didn’t actively seek out the great green room, but if someone nudged me across the threshold I could navigate without bawling.Then our son arrived in the world like a comet breaking the sound barrier, or Kramer skidding into Jerry’s apartment. There was no reading to this infant; he would slither free of blankets and rock bouncy chairs across the floor, bellowing so loudly that the force of his voice would push his eyebrows into his hairline. He scaled bookshelves while I ran a bath; crawled holes in the knees of his onesies; rattled the slats of his crib like an unruly inmate demanding a call to his lawyer.He was bewitching, sweet, playful and wildly entertaining, the kind of baby strangers admired in the grocery store. But his evening routine almost broke me. It went on for hours: dinner, tub, stories, singing, wailing, more singing, more wailing. He wanted someone to lie down with him. He wanted someone to hold his hand. He wanted a different person to hold his other hand. The requests became more plaintive and exacting as the evening wore on. Yes, we tried letting him cry.I avoided pitying glances from neighbors. I consulted my sister, my friends, the pediatrician and the pediatrician mother of my husband’s friend’s wife. I took up knitting. I fell asleep reading books about sleep.One night as I braced for impact, still wearing a too-snug dress from work, I plucked the familiar orange spine from our jumble of library books and aspirational novels ( “Little House on the Prairie,” “Anne of Green Gables,” “Little Women”). I brought it to my daughter’s bed, where my kids waited on a patchwork quilt stitched with frogs, cats and sad bears. (Why are bears so tragic?)As I read — “Goodnight kittens and goodnight mittens, goodnight clocks and goodnight socks” — the manic energy dropped by 15 degrees. The room was so quiet, I could hear the cat purring and our neighbor playing the piano. Remember the moment when “The Wizard of Oz” goes from black-and-white to color? It was like that.A warm, doughy starfish hand came to rest on my wrist and remained there as I turned the pages. A fragrant, damp head plunked onto my shoulder. At the end of the book, my son took a finger out of his mouth and said quietly, “Again.”On the second reading, we laughed about the mush; it is a funny word, after all. We found the mouse who pops up in a different place in every picture — Where’s Waldo, rodent edition. I pointed out the copy of “Goodnight Moon” on the little rabbit’s bedside table and “The Runaway Bunny” (also by Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurd) on the bookshelf. My daughter counted the stars.Suddenly, I saw the bunnies in a new light. The little one wasn’t sad; he was calm. The big one wasn’t cold or negligent; she was a reassuring presence. Together they were at peace, enjoying their view of the moon and the deepening shadows over a well-organized, thoughtfully-arranged room. Everything had a match: the socks, the slippers, the mittens, even the kittens. The curtains were neatly tied back, both on the actual windows and in the warmly-lit doll house. This was a fantasy world, one I yearned to be part of even more than I wanted a kid who loved to read.That night, possibly for the first time in his life, my son fell asleep without protest. While I sang his personalized alphabet song — each letter stood for something crucial, and if you fumbled one you had to start all over — I looked down at his toddler face and knew I was catching a glimpse of the young man he would become.In the movie version of this story, we would read “Goodnight Moon” every night. When our youngest arrived, her siblings would present her with a fresh copy — a board book, perhaps, or a waterproof teething edition. Our son would never rabble-rouse at bedtime again. He’d dress up as one of the creators of “Goodnight Moon” for the third grade wax museum, a grand occasion when students impersonate people they admire. When he went to college, he’d tack the tattered dust jacket to the bulletin board in his dorm room.In real life, we read “Goodnight Moon” many, many times but it was just part of the rotation — a favorite outfit, not a uniform. Our older kids had nothing to offer their baby sister except eternal devotion, and that was enough. Our son was Steve Jobs in the wax museum. He is now an Olympic sleeper. When I told him I was writing about the great green room, he said, “Cool,” which is teenage boy for “I have no idea what you’re talking about and can’t be bothered to ask.”In a cinematic twist — for me, at least — we left our son at college the day before “Goodnight Moon” celebrated its 75th birthday. (His only piece of art was a Sopranos poster; alas, there wasn’t enough wall space to hang it.) When I said goodbye, I thought of the old lady rabbit in the blue dress, knowing her little bunny would be OK when she left the room. I hugged my son. I told him how much I love him. I told him to be brave and kind. Then I put on my gigantic sunglasses, walked down two flights of stairs, passed other parents who probably read “Goodnight Moon” to their kids, and went home. Yes, I cried.Did the big bunny worry about her son (as I like to think of him)? Did she press her ear to the door, listening and wondering how he was doing in there? Maybe, maybe not. The point is, she knew he was ready to be alone. According to the two clocks in his room, she’d already been sitting with him for over an hour. The time had come!I’ve been a mother for long enough to know that my kids know I’m there for them when we’re apart. And I want them to be out in the world, exploring, learning, imagining, figuring out what’s important to them. I’ve seen the alternative — the year of school in their bedrooms, the constant togetherness, the socially-distanced visits with the friends who are their oxygen — and I won’t romanticize it. After living with three cooped-up teenagers, “Goodnight nobody” sounds more like a lullaby than a dirge.Maybe this is why we give “Goodnight Moon” to new parents — why we inscribe its cheerful yellow endpapers with encouraging notes, why I know all 131 words by heart, a decade after I stopped reading it at bedtime. It’s a blueprint for peace in a time of chaos, and it reminds us how independence can be another kind of oxygen, one that’s necessary for humans and bunnies of all ages. The cozy light, the fresh pajamas, the promise of rest and dreams, the chance to do it all again tomorrow? It was always within reach, and it didn’t last long. But it was enough.Images from “Goodnight Moon” by Margaret Wise Brown, illustrated by Clement Hurd. Used with permission of HarperCollins Children’s Books.</body>

	<title>Maker of the Theragun Massage Device Raises $165 Million</title>
	<author>Lauren Hirsch</author>
	<body>Therabody, the maker of the Theragun hand-held massage device, a cult favorite among athletes, has raised $165 million, the DealBook team reports. The fund-raising round, which was led by the private equity firm North Castle Partners, comes as wellness businesses seek to regain their footing as the pandemic recedes.During the height of the pandemic, money poured into home fitness. Sales of Peloton and Tonal workout equipment skyrocketed. Companies like Peloton are now scaling back as demand falters, but Benjamin Nazarian, Therabody’s chief executive, says the pandemic highlighted a need to take care of your body.“Whether it’s a recession or not, your body is the most valuable thing you have in your life,” Mr. Nazarian said. Last year, Therabody’s revenue reached $396 million, up from $224 million in 2020.Executives did not disclose the valuation of the latest fund-raising round. “The idea of having products for recovery in your home — we still think is a fairly young concept,” said Jon Canarick, a managing partner at North Castle, whose investments include Barry’s Bootcamp and HydroMassage.Theragun will use the money to invest in digital content and acquisitions. It’s also set to announce eight new products on Tuesday, including smart goggles to help relieve facial tension and headaches, as well as a new mini Theragun. The financing includes investment from a broad array of enterprises and celebrities, such as the comedian Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat Ventures and the model Karlie Kloss.“I had been a consumer and a superfan for a while,” Ms. Kloss said. She did not disclose the size of her investment.Fending off copycats will be key. Therabody has settled with more than 15 companies over intellectual property infringement. Yet it continues to see competitors offering massage guns cheaper than its $400 Theragun Elite.People “think that the low price point is going to take the entire market — and that is probably a very naïve understanding of, I would say, any consumer business,” Mr. Nazarian said. “Tell me one industry where there is no premium brand.”</body>

	<body>MARACAIBO, Venezuela — Cuando Ana Villalobos escuchó que un grupo de migrantes venezolanos estaba en el centro de una controversia política en Estados Unidos, se sintió angustiada de inmediato.Hacía solo unos cuantos días, su hija había salido de esa ciudad asolada por la crisis rumbo al norte junto con otras 40 personas, algunas de ellas niños y mujeres embarazadas, decididas a cruzar el Tapón del Darién, una ruta muy peligrosa que atraviesa Panamá y Colombia, para llegar a Estados Unidos.Poco después, había perdido contacto con ella.Luego, Villalobos se enteró de que los gobernadores republicanos en Estados Unidos han empezado a enviar a los migrantes recién llegados, como su hija, a otros estados del país.“Los venezolanos estamos sufriendo mucho como para que nos traten de esa manera en ese país”, dijo.Sin embargo, hasta ahora, la reacción de las autoridades latinoamericanas ha sido muy débil ante las más recientes maniobras del gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, quien envió dos aviones con personas que habían migrado a Martha’s Vineyard, y las del gobernador de Texas, Greg Abbott, quien mandó dos autobuses a la residencia de la vicepresidenta de Estados Unidos, Kamala Harris, en Washington.Las decisiones de estos gobernadores han sido sus iniciativas más visibles para impugnar las políticas de inmigración del presidente Joe Biden y para poner de manifiesto la cantidad histórica de migrantes que llegan a la frontera sur estadounidense, algo de lo que culpan a los demócratas.Algunas personas en Latinoamérica que han abordado el tema acusaron a DeSantis y a Abbott de estar muy desconectados de la crisis en Venezuela, e incluso de ser hipócritas, dada la dureza con la que los republicanos han criticado al gobierno venezolano de Nicolás Maduro, a quien culpan de la crisis.Arturo Sarukhán, quien fue embajador de México en Estados Unidos, escribió en Twitter que DeSantis estaba usando a los migrantes como “utilería política”, lo que calificó como “repugnante y reprobable”.“El hecho de que muchos de ellos fueran venezolanos, sencillamente contradice la supuesta preocupación que los políticos republicanos de Florida dicen tener por la democracia y los derechos humanos” en Latinoamérica, escribió.Maduro no ha dicho nada públicamente sobre el envío de migrantes ni sobre las crecientes repercusiones políticas en Estados Unidos.La legisladora de Colombia Karmen Ramírez Boscán, quien representa en el Congreso a los colombianos que viven en el extranjero, señaló el viernes que no era correcto que los dirigentes electos de Estados Unidos usaran “el dolor y el sufrimiento de la gente para obtener beneficios políticos”.“La migración no es un arma para la política”, añadió en una entrevista.Antes del más reciente movimiento de los migrantes de Florida y Texas, otros líderes de Latinoamérica habían criticado de manera más amplia el trato que les daba Estados Unidos a los migrantes que entraban de manera no autorizada al país.El presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, también ha criticado a los políticos estadounidenses por usar la migración como un arma política, por ejemplo, cuando a principios de este año Abbott firmó un decreto en el que autorizaba a la Guardia Nacional de Texas a detener a migrantes.“Como hay elecciones en noviembre, entonces buscan el sensacionalismo, el amarillismo”, dijo López Obrador en una conferencia de prensa en julio. “No vemos bien que haya campañas antiinmigrantes con propósitos electorales, lo considero inmoral, politiquero”.En Maracaibo, una ciudad en un estado petrolero que solía ser muy próspero en el oeste de Venezuela, Villalobos, de 53 años, dijo que su hija, egresada de bachillerato, se fue porque con sus dos trabajos, en la venta de ropa y en un restaurante, a la familia no le alcanzaba “ni siquiera para la comida de una semana”.“Aquí vivimos cinco personas, dos son ancianos y un niño y ya estábamos desesperados”, aclaró Villalobos.En dos días, no había tenido noticias de su hija.Una vecina, Zulay Chirinos, tenía una amiga que iba en el mismo grupo que intentaba llegar a Estados Unidos. Su amiga, de 21 años, tenía cuatro meses de embarazo, añadió Chirinos.“Me dicen que por qué se arriesgó”, dijo. “Se arriesgó porque es morir en el camino o morir aquí”.Los migrantes que los gobernadores envían a todo Estados Unidos son una pequeña parte de una extraordinaria crisis que se desarrolla más al sur. Desde 2013, millones de venezolanos han huido de una crisis económica, social y democrática manufacturada por el gobierno de izquierda de ese país, uno que los economistas han calificado como el peor, si no considera un escenario de guerra, en décadas.Muchos de esos migrantes huyeron a otros países de Sudamérica, pero como la pandemia ha afectado a las economías sudamericanas, muchos venezolanos ahora se dirigen hacia el norte.Se calcula que 6,8 millones de venezolanos, más de una quinta parte de su población, han abandonado el país, lo cual representa el desplazamiento internacional más grande en la historia del hemisferio.Estados Unidos ha intentado contener la afluencia con el respaldo de un programa de visas que permite a los venezolanos vivir y trabajar en Colombia, pero eso solo tiene un efecto limitado.Según las autoridades de Panamá, el año pasado, las personas que cruzaron a pie por el Tapón del Darién, el cual conecta Sudamérica con Centroamérica, alcanzaron una cifra histórica: de menos de 10.000 en 2020 a más de 130.000.Este año, los cruces a través del atroz sendero de la selva están por romper ese récord, y la enorme mayoría de migrantes son venezolanos.Daniel Cooper Bermúdez, director de Hearts on Venezuela, una organización que busca despertar conciencia sobre la situación humanitaria del país, señaló que los políticos estadounidenses estaban usando a los migrantes venezolanos como una “maniobra política”.“En un país que se dice un representante de la libertad y promotor de derechos humanos para la población debería haber coherencia dentro y fuera de Venezuela”, dijo.Y en Maracaibo, varias personas dijeron que el flujo migratorio solo continuará debido a la situación difícil en Venezuela, que no da muestras de amainar.Dos trabajadores de la construcción de la ciudad, un padre y un hijo, partieron el viernes hacia Estados Unidos.Yudi, la esposa y madre de los trabajadores, dijo que se habían ido porque ya no tenían dinero para comprar comida. (Yudi, por temor a que compartir su historia provocara la deportación de su familia si lograban llegar a Estados Unidos, pidió que solo se usara su nombre de pila).“Sí tenemos temor por lo que les pueda pasar, pero ya nada de lo que les pagaban a ellos por el trabajo alcanzaba para nada”, dijo. “A veces hay que arriesgarse”.Oscar Lopez colaboró con este reportaje desde Ciudad de México.Julie Turkewitz es jefa del buró de los Andes, que cubre Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Perú, Surinam y Guyana.

	<title>To Expand, Arts Centers Seek to Build Their Own Community</title>
	<author>Miranda S. Spivack</author>
	<body>Not long after Linda C. Harrison became chief executive and director of the Newark Museum, she strolled through the four-and-a-half-acre campus in the heart of the city and examined two parking lots on the site.“These were kind of sleepy little lots,” she said.She decided that the parcels could be put to better use by helping the museum get on a sturdier financial footing and, at the same time, helping fuel redevelopment in Newark.That was more than three years ago. The museum, now known as the Newark Museum of Art, is poised to become one of the city’s newest mixed-use developers. The two parking lots have been sold to a developer who will help Ms. Harrison realize her vision — a vibrant arts district called Museum Parc, which will include two buildings with 250 apartments. Fifty of them will be moderately priced rentals that she hopes will attract artists and families.Variations on that concept — arts institutions as developers or as catalysts for development — are taking hold in cities across the United States. In some instances, the arts organizations own the land and seek out a developer and help design the project. In others, they enter into partnerships with developers to obtain space inside a mixed-use project.For artists, navigating the world of real estate does not always come naturally. But the decline of storefront retail has led developers to look for other ways to make their projects stand out, and many have turned to the arts.In Newark, the museum has joined with LMXD, an arm of L+M Development Partners, to create a $92 million plan. The project will allow the museum, New Jersey’s largest, to expand its galleries, renovate its education center, expand a restaurant, enlarge its gift shop and redesign its outdoor sculpture garden.In addition to the sale of the parking lots, the deal relies on a complex financing agreement that includes a 99-year lease on land rented to the museum by LMXD, which will also build apartments on the site. Underpinning the concept, Ms. Harrison said, is the idea that the museum will “become of the community, not just sitting in the community.”“We are committing to the vibrancy not only of ourselves but of helping to transform the city,” she said.Similarly, National Black Theater, which owns an entire block in Harlem, was in a strong position to influence the design of a new development. Sade Lythcott, the theater’s chief executive and the daughter of its founder, Barbara Ann Teer, said her mother had the foresight to buy the block in 1983, a move that helped sustain the theater for decades.The theater has teamed with LMXD and Ray, another developer, on a $185 million project. Plans include apartments designed with space for artists and artisans, and Ms. Lythcott is also interested in developing a co-working space, a library for performing arts and a maker studio as part of an ecosystem that will support local artists.“We want to be an antidote to gentrification,” she said.In some cases, a developer seeks out an arts organization to augment its project.Rocky Bucano, the founder and executive director of the Universal Hip Hop Museum, had been trying for more than 10 years to find a way to bring his concept to life before he connected with L+M Development Partners and the developer Type A Projects, who together enlisted him to join their project in the Bronx.The museum, which is in temporary space in the Bronx Terminal Market, is expected to open in the Bronx Point project in 2024. Perched on a vacant city lot, the $350 million development is expected to include 540 affordable apartments, retail space and space for youth programs, among other amenities.Mr. Bucano said he was pleased to see his vision finally realized, not far from hip-hop’s origins in the Bronx.“Hip-hop is a creative art form that represents the voice of the voiceless,” he said. “You can see the influence hip-hop has had on community activism, fashion, filmmaking and dance. It has permeated every part of today’s modern society.”In San Francisco, Brookfield Properties is cognizant of the influence of the arts at Pier 70. A historic industrial center and shipbuilding site, the pier has been the longtime home of the Noonan Building Artists and is close to the artsy Dogpatch neighborhood. Brookfield hopes to retain that vibe as it redevelops Pier 70 in partnership with the Port of San Francisco.The $3 billion project will include market-rate and affordable housing, office space, parks, and spaces for artists and light manufacturing. But the developer is still searching for a partner for the arts portions, said Swathi Bonda, a senior director at Brookfield Properties.Artists are often early occupants of budding communities, which typically offer relatively cheap rents and large spaces that can be converted into studios or performance venues. Their presence can help neighborhoods become more vibrant and attract developers, but they risk being priced out of an area they had helped revive.Mixed-use developments that include affordable housing and art spaces can be a solution, said Cristy Johnston Limón, who is the principal of Proxima Partners, a management consulting firm in Oakland, Calif. She is working with Arte Amėricas, a nonprofit in Fresno, Calif., to develop a space that will focus on Latino arts and culture.“The idea of putting the artists at the helm of their own narrative means that folks are able to live, work and play in the community that they have already been in all the time,” she said.Ms. Limón was able to collaborate with a developer who built 21 market-rate condos in an abandoned warehouse in Oakland. In 2015, Destiny Arts Center, a youth-oriented dance and martial arts organization that she was leading, opened its new home there in a 10,000-square-foot space, which cost the arts group about $1.7 million to buy and build out.Elsewhere in Oakland, the EastSide Arts Alliance teamed up with Community Vision, a Northern California lender to nonprofit groups, to buy a building to house its cultural center with 16 moderately priced apartments and four retail spaces. The arts alliance leases a city lot across the street for outdoor events, and, according to Elena Serrano, the alliance’s program director, it is contemplating buying the site to develop affordable housing, studio space and an outdoor performance space.Not far from the alliance site, the Black Cultural Zone Community Development Corporation is working on a plan with city officials to acquire a 1.13-acre parcel known as Liberation Park to construct an arts hub and moderately priced housing and retail. The site is already home to the Akoma Outdoor Market and an outdoor roller rink.And officials in Santa Fe, N.M., are looking for ways to redevelop the former campus of Santa Fe University of Art and Design, which closed in 2018. Daniel Hernandez, a development consultant, is helping devise plans to attract a developer for a project that will include housing, stores, open space and a major role for the arts with studios, galleries, workshops and performance spaces.The city owns the 64-acre campus, and development is expected to incorporate some of the remaining buildings — a movie theater, film production studios and a performing arts center donated by the actress Greer Garson, as well as a visual arts center and library.The arts are often seen as a way to create new neighborhoods or revitalize existing ones, said Catherine Howard, president of Community Vision.“For so many arts organizations, the costs are prohibitive,” she said. “We like to focus on ownership, which is power-building, wealth-building, and is combating gentrification.”</body>

	<title>Coach Leonard Hamilton: ‘The Worse the Program, the More I Became Interested’</title>
	<author>Billy Witz</author>
	<body>Leonard Hamilton was on the ninth floor of the stately New York Athletic Club with its million-dollar views over Central Park, accepting the Joe Lapchick Character Award at a luncheon on Friday. Outside, a chauffeur waited to whisk him across the Hudson River to a private plane that would deliver the Florida State men’s basketball coach back to Tallahassee, Fla.It was quite the departure from his first visit to New York.That came 50 years ago, when Hamilton was a wet-behind-the-ears assistant coach at Austin Peay State University in Tennessee. Hamilton walked to the La Guardia Airport car rental counter only to discover that he could not pay cash for a car — and he did not have a credit card. So he jumped in a cab and asked the driver to take him to the cheapest hotel he could find near a gym in Brooklyn.When Hamilton got to the gym, he heard other coaches talking about a hot prospect from the neighborhood. So he pulled aside Rodney Parker, a street basketball consigliere whom any recruiter in the city had better get to know, and asked if he could introduce him to this phenom. The next night, they went to the prospect’s apartment a little before he was expected home at 7. His mother answered the door. They talked and talked, Hamilton turning on the charm.After a while, Parker left, and they talked some more.Sometime after midnight, when the mother excused herself to use the bathroom, Hamilton turned the clock back a couple of hours lest she ask him to leave. When she went to the bathroom again, he pulled the blinds down, lest she discover the sun would soon be peeking through. Finally, just around 7 a.m., in walked a sinewy 6-foot-5 teenager with a bushy Afro and a sly grin.Immediately, Hamilton hit it off with James Williams, whom everyone knew as Fly.“I was following him around playing All-Star games,” Hamilton said. “Nobody knew me, and I never wore anything with Austin Peay on it, so Fly, being the jokester that he was, told everybody I was his cousin. I actually sat in on two recruiting meetings with other schools. He said, ‘I can’t talk with anybody without my cuz.’”Soon, Williams, the playground legend, arrived in Clarksville, Tenn., with his best friend, Danny Odums, creating a college basketball craze and a classic chant: “Fly’s Open, Let’s Go Peay.”Austin Peay, which had finished last in the Ohio Valley Conference the previous season, nearly reached the Mideast regional final of the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament in 1973, losing in overtime to Kentucky.Hamilton, 74, was the first Black player at the University of Tennessee at Martin and the first Black coach in the Southeastern Conference when he was hired as an assistant at Kentucky in 1974. He is getting ready for his 21st season at Florida State, where he has coached six first-round draft picks since 2016 — including the reigning N.B.A. rookie of the year, Scottie Barnes — and where 73 of the 75 players who have completed their eligibility have graduated.He spoke to The New York Times last week about growing up in the segregated South, taking on reclamation projects, why he doesn’t think about the what-ifs of the pandemic and when he’ll retire.Questions and answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.You quit coaching when you were told Austin Peay would not hire a Black head coach, right?It wasn’t quite like that. I went to talk to the university president when I thought Coach (Lake) Kelly might leave to see if there was a chance I could replace him. He said he was retiring in a couple years and nothing would make him happier than for me to be the coach at Austin Peay. Politically, he said he didn’t know if he was strong enough to get it done. He was being honest with me, but that cut my guts out.So you quit?I got a job at Dow Chemicals. My first day on the job, I got a call from Joe Hall (the Kentucky coach), who had become aware of me because we almost beat them. Near the end of my interview, I said, “I’m going to tell you four things: I’ll be loyal to you, nobody will outwork me, you’ll have players, and I won’t get you in trouble. But if you’re not going to offer me the job, I’m going to go back to Charlotte and be the No. 1 chemicals salesman in the country.”You spent 12 years as an assistant at Kentucky (winning the 1978 championship with the team), but your head coaching jobs have been at places that were not exactly blue bloods. Oklahoma State hadn’t won an N.C.A.A. tournament game in more than two decades; Miami had recently resurrected its program 15 years after dropping it; and Florida State had always been a football school. Is that a coincidence?As an assistant coach, like most young coaches, I was dreaming. I wanted to be somewhere that had good facilities, was in the vicinity of good players and that had won. I wanted to find one of those good, cushy jobs where I could really go to work. But then it’s almost like God slapped me on both sides of my face and said, “Those programs don’t need you.” It was almost like a vision — if you’re going to make a name in this business, you’re going to have to go somewhere that is extremely challenging. The worse the program, the more I became interested. That would be a way for me to earn my stripes.How much did your upbringing in Gastonia, N.C., prepare you for that, having to make do with less?There were eight of us living in a two-bedroom house. Our bathroom was on the back porch, there was no hot and cold running water. I took my bath in a tin tub. Everybody in our neighborhood lived that way. This was an era when we were still drinking out of a colored water fountain, using a colored bathroom, sitting in the back of the bus. We lived 30 or 40 yards from my church — Mount Zion Baptist, at the corner of Allison and Morris, where everybody is somebody and Christ is all. I could hear the piano from our back porch, and if the doors were open, we were there. It gave me a moral compass. All of those circumstances, even the negative part of segregation, prepared me mentally. It gave me a toughness, a desire, a will to fight and a determination to try to overcome challenges.Last year, Gaston College, the community college you attended in your hometown, resurrected its athletic program after 50 years, bringing back five sports, including men’s basketball. You urged the college’s board of trustees to do this. Why?Most Blacks in that time got their education through the G.I. Bill, so that’s what I was going to do in 1966 — join the Army. My mother went to school up to the seventh grade, my father went to the ninth grade. The coach convinced me I could always join the Army but this would be a good experience. And he was right. Gaston College meant so much to me because I was a guy who needed some direction. I needed small classrooms. I needed the relationships. I needed that environment. Every Wednesday night, my coach would take me to Howard Johnson’s. He was teaching me how to eat pasta. He wanted me to take the fork and the spoon and curl it up, which made no sense to me. It helped prepare me to go to Tennessee-Martin. I had three younger brothers and a sister who looked to me for leadership. Getting my degree set the table for them.In 2020, Florida State was 26-5, A.C.C. champions, ranked fourth and picked by some to get to the Final Four, where you have never been. Then the pandemic hit and the N.C.A.A. tournament was canceled. How often do you think about what might have been?I don’t. When you think about the negative effect that continuing to play those games could have had on a lot of people, me standing up there saying “I’m No. 1” pales in comparison. I would have loved to have played for a championship, but the most important thing is it was the right decision to make.In the past two years, Roy Williams retired at North Carolina, Mike Krzyzewski retired at Duke and Jay Wright retired at Villanova. You turned 74 last month, you just had hip replacement surgery, and you coached with a ruptured Achilles’ tendon in last year’s N.C.A.A. tournament. How long do you want to coach?This is my ministry. This is my calling. This is what I’m built for — to help young people fulfill their dreams. I don’t play golf. I don’t hunt. I don’t fish. I’m boring. I always tell my staff that if I don’t come out of the locker room and go to the wrong bench, then I’m going to stay here.</body>

	<title>Ford Says It Will Spend $1 Billion More in Third Quarter Because of Supply Chain Problems</title>
	<author>Neal E. Boudette</author>
	<body>Ford Motor said on Monday that the costs of parts would be $1 billion higher in the third quarter of the year than it had expected because of inflation and shortages of some components.The company and other automakers have been slowed by a computer-chip shortage for nearly two years. Industry executives had expected the squeeze to ease in the second half of this year but Ford’s warning indicates that the supply chain chaos is continuing to hurt car companies and could drag into 2023.Ford said it expected to end the third quarter with 40,000 to 45,000 mostly completed vehicles that cannot be shipped to dealers because they are missing certain components. That’s higher than the company had expected. In July, about 53,000 vehicles were not completed.The automaker warned that a large portion of the uncompleted models include high-margin trucks and sport-utility vehicles that generate a significant share of Ford’s profit.The company said it now expected to report adjusted earnings before income and taxes of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion for the third quarter. But Ford is sticking with its previous forecast of full-year adjusted earnings of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion.To reach that goal, Ford will need a strong performance in the last three months of the year, given the higher costs in the July-to-September period. The company will report its third-quarter results on Oct. 26.After Ford’s announcement, the company’s stock price was down about 4 percent in Tuesday’s premarket session.</body>

	<title>Spotify Makes a Bet on Audiobooks</title>
	<author>Elizabeth A. Harris</author>
	<body>Spotify made the lucrative audiobook market more competitive on Tuesday, when it debuted a new hub on its app with more than 300,000 titles, among them books by best-selling authors like Colleen Hoover, Michelle Obama and Stephen King.The company transformed the music industry when it gave listeners access to a seemingly limitless catalog of songs through its streaming music service more than a decade ago. Now Spotify’s move into audiobooks could reshape what has become a rapidly growing category for publishers.In a surprising shift away from its all-you-can-listen ethos, Spotify is selling audiobooks à la carte, rather than offering a subscription service. Executives declined to detail the revenue sharing model with publishers, but said that prices will vary per title and will be in line with other retailers.Digital audio has grown by double digits year-over-year for more than a decade. Audiobook revenues totaled $1.67 billion last year, up 25 percent from 2020, according to the Audio Publishers Association. Last year, nearly 74,000 audiobooks were released, compared to some 7,200 in 2011.Spotify’s executives see an even bigger opportunity, they said. Despite the recent growth, they said, audiobooks represent less than a 7 percent share of the wider book market.“We believe we have the potential to massively expand the audience for audiobooks,” Nir Zicherman, the head of audiobooks at Spotify, said during a news conference on Monday. “Just as Spotify has changed the way that people create and listen to music and podcasts, we believe we can do the same thing over time with audiobooks, by offering new formats, new ways to interact with content and new ways to discover.”Zicherman added that Spotify aims to improve curation in the audiobook marketplace, and to study its users’ engagement with different titles so that it can eventually develop an algorithmic audiobook recommendation engine, similar to the way the service recommends music based on listeners’ tastes. For the moment, its audiobook hub is only available to Spotify users in the United States.Spotify’s audiobook push is a gamble for the company, which added podcasts, comedy performances and other spoken-word entertainment to its offerings and announced its ambition to become the leading service for all things audio.While the company has grown substantially in terms of content, subscribers, users and revenue, it has still never reported an annual profit. Their stock price has tumbled over the last year, and is now lower than when the company went public in 2018. Some analysts and investors are also skeptical of Spotify’s heavy investment in podcasts.Many in the publishing world are hopeful that Spotify will convert some of its users into audiobook lovers.“It’s an opportunity to take their heavy listeners in music and podcasts and get those listeners to try audiobooks,” said Michele Cobb, the executive director of the Audio Publishers Association.Spotify has 188 million paying subscribers globally. Getting even a fraction of them to buy audiobooks could mean millions of new listeners for books.“It’s introducing more competition into the marketplace,” said Chris Lynch, the president and publisher of the audio division at Simon &amp; Schuster. “And introducing another major outlet that has a built-in listening audience is a great thing.”Still, it’s unclear how Spotify users will adapt to paying for books one at a time, when many are accustomed to streaming music and shows on the platform for free or through a monthly subscription. While Spotify determined, through conversations with publishers, that à la carte sales made the most sense, the company plans to experiment with other models in the future, possibly including one that would incorporate advertising, Zicherman said.Audiobook listeners already had several platforms to choose from, including Apple, Google and libro.fm, which distributes digital audiobooks for independent booksellers. Audible, the audio production and retail platform owned by Amazon, is by far the biggest audiobook retailer, with more than 760,000 titles, including thousands of audio originals. Much of the company’s business comes in the form of a monthly or annual membership plan, which gives listeners a certain number of credits that can be redeemed for audiobooks.Spotify’s chief executive, Daniel Ek, has hinted that the company is prepared to invest heavily in order to compete with Audible. “Just as we’ve done in podcasting, expect us to play to win,” Ek said during a presentation to investors in June. “And, with one major player dominating the space, we believe we will expand the market, and create value for users and creators alike.”Spotify had already made some inroads into the audiobook arena. This summer, they completed a deal to buy the audiobook creator and distributor Findaway, which distributes more than 325,000 audiobooks, for $119 million. At a presentation to investors this summer, Spotify executives were bullish on the future for the medium, saying they expect the audiobook market to grow from its current size of $3.3 billion to $15 billion in the next five years.Ben Sisario contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>Another Culture War Front: Are Companies Too ‘Woke’ When It Comes to Climate?</title>
	<author>David Gelles</author>
	<body>This article is part of Climate Solutions, a special report on efforts to make a difference, coinciding with The New York Times Climate Forward conference and Climate Week NYC.On a muggy day in Tampa this summer, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida took the podium and unleashed an attack on what he claimed was one of the principal threats to the livelihoods and freedoms of upstanding American citizens.“This is something in many respects that is crushing the little guy,” he said. “So we want to make sure that we’re standing on the side of average people.”Mr. DeSantis was not talking about aggression from overseas, high gas prices, inflation, pandemic lockdowns or even the Democratic Party.Instead, he was talking about the rise of E.S.G., a catchall term in the corporate world used to denote a business’s focus on issues like climate change and diversity.Standing before a banner that read, “Government of Laws, Not Woke CEOs,” Mr. DeSantis railed against companies that he said were trying to use their power to advance a liberal agenda.“From Wall Street banks to massive asset managers and big tech companies, we have seen the corporate elite use their economic power to impose policies on the country that they could not achieve at the ballot box,” he said.Mr. DeSantis went on to announce measures intended to reduce the role of E.S.G. — or “environmental, social and governance” policies — in investing in Florida’s pension system. In doing so, he said, he was “asserting the authority of our constitutional system over ideological corporate power.” Besides stoking fears of globalism, it was a message likely to resonate with his base.For nearly two decades developed economies throughout the world have adopted E.S.G. investing policies — setting aspirational targets to reduce carbon emissions, use more renewable energy or add more diversity to the work force — virtually without controversy.The need for more such policies and commitment of funds for climate mitigation and adaptation will be among the topics discussed this week as scientists, corporate sustainability officers, government officials and others, including former Vice President Al Gore and John Kerry, now the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, gather in New York for The New York Times Climate Forward conference.The event is part of Climate Week, an annual global summit that runs during the United Nations General Assembly, where the role of corporations in combating climate change and achieving social justice is emphasized, with such panels as “Investing in Equity and the Economy.”But in recent months, what has become a plain vanilla bit of sustainability reporting in other parts of the world has, along with the related term “stakeholder capitalism,” emerged as the latest front in the culture wars roiling American politics.Conservatives in the United States, closely aligned with the oil and gas industries, have begun calling foul as companies and investment firms embrace efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address international and local inequities. And in recent months, they have pushed beyond rhetoric to punish corporations that they say are unduly focused on issues that they argue are unrelated to a company’s bottom line.“There’s a lot of politics around the term E.S.G. right now,” said Reid Thomas, a managing director at JTC, a fund manager. “You’ve got different sides pushing back at each other.”Yet even as the rhetoric heats up, and executives brace for more attacks by Republican politicians, most companies and investment firms are standing their ground. Many corporate leaders say that, as a long-term strategy, it is in their best interests to invest in climate solutions and their work forces — and worth the uncomfortable public relations moments in the short term.Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is a frequent champion of E.S.G. He defended the firm’s policies in his annual letter to chief executives this year.“Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics,” he wrote. “It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not ‘woke.’ It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper.”Tensions between conservative and corporate America have been growing for years. After the election of former President Donald J. Trump, many chief executives found themselves at odds with the White House on issues including immigration, race relations and efforts to mitigate climate change by reining in oil and gas production and use.Now, in addition to staking out policy positions that are unpopular with many Republicans, big corporations and investment firms are working to integrate E.S.G. more deeply into their businesses.Rarely do the setting of such goals result in swift and dramatic changes to how firms operate. And indeed, many companies are accused of greenwashing — touting their commitments to E.S.G. without instituting any real reforms.Nevertheless, conservative leaders are now taking on the biggest companies in the country, attacking E.S.G. and working to portray environmental and social priorities as bad for business and politically motivated — evidence, they charge, that corporate America is committed to globalism and in cahoots with the left.A record number of anti-E.S.G. shareholder proposals were introduced over the last year.Texas became the first state to pass a law that barred major financial institutions from state business if they were deemed to be “boycotting” the oil and gas industry. In truth, the financial firms targeted by the law still do ample business with the fossil fuel industry, but have pulled back lending for some parts of the oil and gas business that they believe to be poor investments. How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.Several more states, including West Virginia and Oklahoma, have passed similar laws this year.At the same time, Republican state attorneys general have targeted BlackRock, accusing it of putting its “climate agenda” ahead of clients and being in league with climate activists because it is supporting the goals established at the Paris climate conference in 2015 and working on efforts to phase out fossil fuels, which are dangerously warming the planet. Former Vice President Mike Pence, a potential presidential contender in 2024, said this summer that he wanted to “rein in” E.S.G.A financial firm that says it is guided by biblical principles, Inspire Investing, lashed out at companies pursuing E.S.G. efforts, saying that the term has “become weaponized by liberal activists to push forward their harmful, social-Marxist agenda.”Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has also soured on the term. “ESG is a scam,” he wrote on Twitter earlier this year. “It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.”And with each passing week, more states are taking steps to penalize companies they say are unduly focused on climate issues, with Mr. DeSantis making good on his threat to ban E.S.G. considerations from its pension fund managers, and Texas expanding its list of banned financial institutions to include many of the world’s biggest banks.“I see this anti-ESG push as the next extension of the ongoing culture war,” Kristoffer Inton, an analyst with the research firm Morningstar, said in a recent report. “Many of these thoughts, and even some of the bills, are written without a great understanding of sustainable investing. Any investor who ignores ESG risk, like any other risk, does so at their own peril.”Yet as the right ratchets up its attacks on companies, most executives are staying the course, at least for now.“We see E.S.G., or resilience, or more specifically our decarbonization and diversity programs, as ways to enhance long term value for our companies,” said Jean Rogers, head of E.S.G. at Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm. “So we are really not looking at the political fray.”Companies say that their efforts to reduce emissions are sound long term investments because the risks of climate change are increasingly material, and that efforts to promote more diversity among their work forces improves corporate culture.“Fund managers and investors aren’t really deterred by all of the noise,” Mr. Thomas said. And, he said, “the money is flowing” in the direction of investing in issues like climate and equity.BlackRock has defended its stance as a sound investment strategy. “We believe investors and companies that take a forward-looking position with respect to climate risk and its implications for the energy transition will generate better long-term financial outcomes,” the company wrote.Many other big companies have taken similar positions. “The market is recognizing this and doing it because it’s good for business, not because it’s part of a political agenda,” said Steven M. Rothstein, managing director at the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets, a group that supports sustainable businesses.What is more, plenty of opportunistic corporations sense that there is money to be made as more renewable energy projects are built around the world.“This transition can lead to enormous opportunities,” Mr. Rothstein said. “There will be trillions invested in green technologies.”Given the absence of uniform standards, what people mean when they say E.S.G. is constantly evolving. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, analysts at Citi made the case that weapons makers and defense contractors should qualify as socially positive investments because they were helping protect democracy.Meanwhile, a whole new industry has emerged of providers offering reports, data, metrics and technology services to help big companies keep track of their E.S.G. efforts.“There are hundreds of different reporting frameworks out there that are all confusing and inconsistent,” Mr. Thomas said. “There are hundreds of different companies out there selling reporting software.Making matters worse is the fact that even those who support corporate efforts to combat climate change acknowledge that some funds and companies that boast of their environmental accomplishments are overstating their impact.“E.S.G. funds do a lot of greenwashing, which we know,” said Mary Cerulli, founder of Climate Finance Action. “It’s tainted the whole legitimacy of the broader framework.”For now at least, conservatives appear to have the upper hand in the battle to control the public narrative.“They’ve been spinning this narrative that E.S.G. is ‘woke,’ and they’ve had a big head start in messaging,” Ms. Cerulli said.Prominent conservative commentators have amplified the message, often misrepresenting what the term means.“E.S.G. has no real definition, but in effect it requires companies and countries to shut down their most productive sectors in the name of climate change and equity,” the Fox News host Tucker Carlson said in a segment this summer.And yet even as the attacks continue, big companies appear to be moving forward with their efforts to prioritize environmental issues.The majority of anti-E.S.G. shareholder proposals have failed to gain support from investors, according to the Morningstar report. More than 90 percent of companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index now publish an E.S.G. report. And the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering adopting new rules that would require public companies to submit more detailed analysis of climate related risks and greenhouse gas emissions.“The private market is speaking,” Mr. Rothstein said. “And they are saying that climate is a risk.”</body>

	<title>A Rural Doctor Gave Her All. Then Her Heart Broke.</title>
	<author>Oliver Whang</author>
	<body>CLAY, W.Va. — For most of her life, Dr. Kimberly Becher has moved fast. She was married at 21, started medical school with a 3-month-old and has trained for two marathons. In the halls of her clinic, between a bank and a Baptist church in Clay — the county seat of Clay County with a population of 396 — she walks fast, often looking down at her phone as she speeds around corners. She talks fast, too, organizing her staff and speaking crisply with a mountain accent.But her aspect changes when she enters an exam room where a patient is waiting. She slows perceptibly, and the otherwise intense beam of her attention softens.Recently, Dr. Becher, in bright pink scrubs, sat with Zane Wilkinson, 15, who had come in for a monthly checkup in the company of his mother, Julia Wilkinson. He wore a newsboy cap and a blue surgical mask; he has Behcet’s disease, a rare autoimmune disorder that, as Ms. Wilkinson described it, “is like having multiple sclerosis, Crohn’s, lupus and arthritis in one bundle.” Zane had been on chemotherapy for five years with mixed results and had not attended school in person since before the pandemic. But the recent combination of drugs was working well, his mother told the doctor: “He’s almost back to being a normal boy.”Dr. Becher made the diagnosis in 2017, after the family had spent years bouncing among doctors in confusion. (“They call her Dr. House, because she can figure out things nobody else can,” Ms. Wilkinson said of Dr. Becher.) The question in July was whether Zane could safely return to the classroom despite the risk of Covid-19.“So, what do you think about school?” Ms. Wilkinson asked Dr. Becher.The doctor tilted her head. “Well, I think you might be at a point where you have to consider the social benefits in addition to the health risks,” she said. “Like, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t have quality of life just because you might get Covid. You’ve got to live your life.” Zane and his mother nodded.“Hoover over Clay?” Dr. Becher asked Zane, referring to two nearby high schools that he could attend, Clay County High School and Herbert Hoover High School. Ms. Wilkinson, who teaches at Hoover, laughed. “Would you like to talk about that?” she asked Zane.“No, not really,” he said.It was the first thing he had said during the visit, and all three of them laughed.Dr. Becher has spent eight years as a family physician in Clay, working for Community Care of West Virginia, a federally qualified health center. West Virginia tops most national lists of poverty and poor health outcomes: the highest prevalence of obesity, coronary disease and diabetes; the fourth-highest poverty rate; the second-highest prevalence of depression; the shortest life expectancy. In Clay County, there is no public transportation, no stoplight, no hospital. Most residents live in a food desert. And as one of only two family doctors in the county, Dr. Becher has an all-encompassing job. She visits children in their living rooms to vaccinate them, organizes food drives and administers Suboxone to treat opioid addiction.But as the political climate around Covid-19 grew heated, and as some of Dr. Becher’s patients and neighbors began to dismiss the science, she became frustrated, then angry. She began to run more, sometimes twice a day, for hours at a time, “raging down the road.” She was mad about the widespread distrust of vaccines; mad about teachers who went to school even after testing positive for the virus; mad about the endemic food insecurity, the county’s lack of affordable transportation, the high rate of fatty liver disease.The indignities layered one atop the next, forming a suffocating stack. More than anything, Dr. Becher was mad at how she couldn’t seem to do anything about any of it. Some days she went home from work, chugged a beer and ran for miles. Then, on April 17, 2021, her heart broke.In 1981, two psychologists at the University of California, Berkeley, published a paper in the Journal of Occupational Behavior on “the burnout syndrome.” The authors, Christina Maslach and Susan E. Jackson, set out to measure the degree of stress and emotional exhaustion experienced by professionals like doctors, social workers, therapists and teachers who, they noted, must constantly navigate complicated interactions “charged with feelings of anger, embarrassment, fear or despair.”Their questionnaire — the Maslach Burnout Inventory, or M.B.I. — is now a scientific standard. Among physicians, a high score on the M.B.I. has been linked to increased errors, decreased patient satisfaction and quick turnover. Burned-out doctors show higher rates of cardiovascular disease, substance abuse and divorce. A 2017 study of about 5,000 physicians published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings found that some 44 percent exhibited at least one sign of burnout. A 2019 report by the National Academy of Medicine pointed to studies showing that 54 percent of physicians and nurses were burned out.“Your patients kind of embrace you as a part of their community; they almost become a part of your family,” said Dr. Tate Hinkle, a family doctor in Lanett, Ala. Many physicians cite these interpersonal connections as the primary reason they go into family medicine. But the sense of dependency can place a significant emotional burden on doctors, Dr. Hinkle said, especially in isolated rural areas, where chronic illnesses and social disadvantages superimpose: “It just adds that sense of pressure on yourself to make sure you take care of people.”On that April day in 2021, Dr. Becher was at a chess tournament with her teenage son when she suddenly felt as if she were having a heart attack. She left for the emergency room, barely able to see, her blood pressure dangerously high.Tests soon revealed that she had a rare disease called takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which forces the tip of the heart’s left ventricle to stretch. Most cases occur in older women who have recently experienced some type of intense physical or emotional distress, like the loss of a loved one or a serious accident. It has gained a catchy moniker — broken heart syndrome — but its causes remain unknown.In the hospital, Dr. Becher argued with the doctors as they tried to treat her. Her clinic’s answering service called her three times while she was being diagnosed; her husband, Mike Becher, had to take away her phone. She protested until she saw the medical imagery: a portion of her heart had been paralyzed, and her left ventricle had ballooned.“The first emotion I felt was actually anger — the very thing that brought me to this cold, hard table,” Dr. Becher wrote in a blog post months later. “Quickly the anger faded, and I felt utterly mortified. I wasn’t tough enough to follow the path I’d set myself on.”She added: “No one put me in this position. I applied to medical school, I sought a job in rural primary care and I poured my identity into it. Takotsubo’s is typically caused by severe acute stress, something traumatic and abrupt. Mine was just from going to work every day and seemed super lame to me in the moment.”Dr. Becher grew up in Sissonville, a small community an hour west of Clay. Her aim was to leave West Virginia and never return. She graduated as valedictorian of her high school class and went to Denison University, in Ohio, where, in one of her first courses, she met her future husband. After college the couple moved to Cincinnati, where he studied environmental law and she worked at an Olive Garden, then in a medical lab.Three years later she was back in West Virginia, with a newborn, studying medicine at Marshall University. “I realized that I liked living here better than I liked living in places with everything I wanted,” she said. In 2014, immediately after finishing her residency, she and her husband and son moved into a house atop a hill in Clendenin, about 30 minutes away from the clinic in Clay. She had $180,000 in debt from student loans.“Mike had two requirements when we were choosing where to live,” Dr. Becher said recently, looking out at the trees and pond at the bottom of her hill. “We couldn’t be able to see any neighbors, and he had to be able to shoot things from the porch.” She liked it. “I need to feel tortured and alone, for some reason,” she said.Dr. Becher spent her first years in Clay building up what she called “patient equity.” She slowed down in her characteristic way when talking to her patients and learning about their lives and health issues, which could stem from causes as varied as diabetes, opioid addiction, anxiety, loss of electricity or an old car that had recently broken down. But outside of these interpersonal relationships, she continued apace. She began blogging for the American Academy of Family Physicians, took on advisory roles in local government, increased the number of patients she saw and made more home visits to people unable to drive to the clinic.“Every couple days Kimberly would come back ranting about insurance companies,” Mr. Becher said. “But she’s been pretty much the same since we first met: intense.”In 2016 a flood destroyed houses along the banks of the Elk River and closed the only grocery store in the county. Dr. Becher visited the local dollar store and came up with a list of inexpensive, minimally processed foods to recommend to her patients. By 2020, with the pandemic in high gear, she was lobbying town officials to bring in a new grocery store and helping to organize monthly food distributions.I was living in eastern Kentucky at the time, reporting on how the pandemic was affecting food access in Appalachian communities, and on a sunny day that autumn I drove out to talk with her. We met behind her clinic, near a parking lot crowded with cars where a half-dozen nurses were busy administering Covid tests through rolled-down windows. Over the next several days, nearly 200 families would benefit from a food giveaway that Dr. Becher had helped coordinate at the high school.“When we have meetings with people involved in the town or the county, there’s this level of, ‘Well, if you keep giving out enough food for two weeks every month, we’re never going to get a store,’” she told me. “But there’s not a store. So I’m going to give out food until there’s a store.”The primary health issues that her patients faced, Dr. Becher said, were hunger and a poor diet. Most of them had the means to buy healthy food, she added, but many drank multiple cans of soda a day. Some could not afford to fix their car and so were unable to drive to the nearest grocery store, an hour away; others had to choose between paying for internet service or fresh produce. With grants from nonprofits, Dr. Becher began paying some people’s bills, but blood-sugar levels and blood-pressure readings kept rising.“You have no way to make that impact,” she said, “and you’re just looking at them like: ‘I know your heart rate is going up. I’m sorry you can’t get food. That really sucks.’”Several months later, early in February 2021, I drove to Clay again. The morning air was crisp, the ground frosty, and I met Dr. Becher in the doorway of her clinic as she was talking to one of her nurses, Cristine Dean. The first Covid vaccine had been released just weeks earlier, and West Virginia had one of the highest vaccination rates in the country; Dr. Becher had been helping lead the region’s efforts. That day she was quarterbacking an operation to bring vaccines to homebound patients. At her disposal were two nurses, 10 vaccine doses, six hours and a four-wheel drive.“I’m excited for you guys,” Dr. Becher told Ms. Dean, who was also her marathon training partner. “I want to do it.”“Yeah, but you got a full schedule,” Ms. Dean replied.Dr. Becher had been working in the clinic seven days a week most weeks, and often stayed up late at her kitchen counter, writing notes on patients’ charts and grant applications for food vouchers. She had begun encountering resistance to Covid science, which added to the strain on her, she said; patients she had seen for years were suddenly questioning her judgment.Friends and colleagues described similar experiences. Dr. Hinkle, in Alabama, whom Dr. Becher had known since residency, described a longtime patient who came in with symptoms of Covid. When the doctor recommended testing, the patient responded, “We’re not going to talk about that; it’s all made up,” Dr. Hinkle said. “And he stormed out of the office and fired me as a doctor.”Several studies have found that the pandemic significantly increased levels of burnout among physicians and health care workers. More than 20 percent of respondents in one study reported being bullied, threatened or harassed by their patients at work. “What Covid has done is taken many people who had no margins left and it pushed them over the edge,” said Dr. Mark Greenawald, a family doctor in Roanoke, Va., who studies burnout among doctors.Later that day in February, Ms. Dean visited the mountaintop home of Bonnie White, one of Dr. Becher’s patients, to administer a second dose of the Covid vaccine. “Do I really need to get the second dose?” Ms. White asked. Ms. Dean replied: “Well, let me put it this way — Dr. Becher thinks you should get it, and Dr. Becher herself got hers. So I think if she wants you to get it, then you can trust her to get it.”Ms. White said: “I do what she tells me to do. She’s the best doctor I’ve ever had.”In practice, most of Dr. Becher’s patients took her advice and got the vaccine. But even as the pandemic introduced an element of distrust to her work, older patients begun coming to her depressed, unable see their children or grandchildren. Dr. Becher and Dr. Joanna Bailey, a family doctor in Wyoming County, W.Va., talked almost every day in a group chat about vaccine distribution, their mounting paperwork and the need to make long-term plans for their communities.“I’ve felt myself getting angry with a patient over this Covid vaccine,” Dr. Bailey told me. “That’s where I decided, I cannot argue about this anymore. I’m going to tell them it’s recommended; I’m going to have my little three lines to say, and that’s it. It’s too big for me.”But Dr. Becher couldn’t let it go. She joined more boards, saw more patients, considered running for a government seat, tried to channel her frustration. Her husband knew that the pace she was keeping was not sustainable, but when they talked about it late at night, they realized there was no stopping, he said: “It was like, she was helping people, and if she didn’t do it, then no one would.”That April, when her heart broke, Dr. Becher stopped seeing patients. She quit every board she was on. For a couple of weeks, on bed rest, she tried to figure out what had gone wrong. “Why had I said yes to doing so many home visits?” she later wrote on the blog. “Why did I work so hard to make food accessible in this town that I don’t even live in?” And: “Why did I keep saying yes to everything anyone asked me to do?”How could she return to her previous life, knowing it had almost killed her?The roots of the challenge ran deep, Dr. Becher came to realize. Many new physicians, often carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans, face a dichotomy once they start practicing.“Rarely is there a health care organization that is able to say that we value your well-being as health care providers above our productivity,” Dr. Becher said recently. Her student debt has gone down but remains above $60,000. “But it’s not just a financial thing,” she said. “It’s that people need care, and when you’re in more rural areas like this, you might be the only source.”In early 2022, Dr. Becher moved to a more administrative role at Community Care of West Virginia and reduced her time in the clinic to one day a week. “I am shifting my focus toward helping other physicians learn from my mistakes, which means I have to actually tell my story,” she wrote in her blog in February. “I am definitely a work in progress, and I am always on the edge of a cliff, at risk of jumping back into being angry and putting myself in a position to be hurt again. But at least now I know there is a cliff.”Dr. Lisa Lavadie-Gomez, a family doctor in Iowa City, Iowa, who had recently experienced a health scare of her own, reached out after reading the post. The two physicians talked about their experiences and later recounted the exchange.“The empathy and altruism wears you out to the point where you’re depleted, and I was depleted,” Dr. Lavadie-Gomez said. “I’m taking care of people with my whole heart, yet I’m completely broken. How do you keep going amid the moral overwhelm?”Dr. Becher responded: “There have been moments, since last April, where it’ll hit me, like, my life is so different from before. Because I had a couple runs of heart rhythms that are not good, there’s also this fear I have, like, what if I literally just die?”Recently Dr. Lavadie-Gomez confided that she had decided to leave medicine. “I will always be a doctor; that will never change,” she said. “I will always have the same skills and empathy, care and ability to solve problems. I’m just choosing to use that energy somewhere else. And I probably just haven’t admitted that I’m leaving my job until right now — today — and my conversation with Kimberly.”On a Friday in late July, Dr. Becher invited Dr. Anne Jarrell, a third-year medical resident from East Tennessee State University, to tag along as she worked her day in the clinic. The region had been without a regular family doctor since April 2021, and Dr. Becher was hoping that Dr. Jarrell, who grew up in West Virginia, could fill that hole.“Like, this is why you do medicine,” Dr. Jarrell said, as the two physicians squeezed into the nurses’ office at midday. Dr. Jarrell, cheerful and energetic with a bandanna holding back her long hair, peppered Dr. Becher with logistical questions. The closest hospital? About 45 minutes from the clinic on the interstate — but it depended on where you were coming from. Dr. Becher’s threshold for prescribing opiates? Very high. The patient population? All over the county. Did she prescribe Plan B, the morning-after contraception pill? “Yes,” Dr. Becher said. Dr. Jarrell voiced her support with a small fist pump.The next appointment was with a young transgender woman, Dany Frye, whom Dr. Becher had been seeing for a couple of years, and who was now weighing the options for surgery.“Do you have her on hormone therapy?” Dr. Jarrell asked.“Yeah,” Dr. Becher said.“Awesome,” Dr. Jarrell said. “So you do that here?”“I do that here,” said Dr. Becher, who has more than a dozen transgender patients. “I would love it if you came here and did it.”Afterward, Ms. Frye reflected on the appointment. “I didn’t know how life-changing it would be,” she said. “Having that resource in such a small county is so shocking. It’s crazy how we just have her here.”Although Dr. Becher’s most recent echocardiogram was normal and her cardiologist cleared her to exercise regularly again, she had not run since April 2021. Mentally she was working up to a turkey trot in November with her husband and son, but her marathon dreams were over. “I just can’t do distance running ever again,” she said. “I mean, that was what I did. That was my hobby. That was all I did.”In her new role at Community Care, Dr. Becher has been developing a support group for rural physicians through the Robert C. Byrd Center for Rural Health at Marshall University. “She kept all this close to her vest for a long time,” said Jennifer Plymale, the director of the center, who has known Dr. Becher since she was in medical school. “But I believe she’s creating a new path for her that’s not all about patient care.”Later that day in the clinic, Dr. Becher and Dr. Jarrell squeezed into a room with Larry O’Dell, a longtime patient whose wife of more than 60 years had recently died. Mr. O’Dell was healthy and cognitively sharp, working in his garden most days, although he had lost most of his hearing. His daughter Sheila accompanied him for the visit, often repeating into his ear, loudly, things that the doctors said.Dr. Becher ran a physical exam, prescribed some medication, then sat and chatted with Mr. O’Dell about his garden and his daughters.“You know what,” he said, suddenly shifting the topic. “You look better than you did the last time I saw you.”“Thank you,” said Dr. Becher, slightly taken aback.“Are you better?” he asked.“I am better,” she said. “I’m a lot better.” There was a pause, then she added, “I was wondering why you were staring at me so weird.” And everyone in the room laughed.Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst.</body>

	<title>A Virginia University Will Pay Hazing Victim’s Family Nearly $1 Million</title>
	<author>Eduardo Medina</author>
	<body>Virginia Commonwealth University has agreed to pay $995,000 to the family of Adam Oakes, a student who died last year from alcohol poisoning at a fraternity party and whose death drew renewed scrutiny of hazing in Greek organizations across the country.The university said in a statement on Friday that, in addition to the payment, it had agreed to make changes to its fraternities and sororities, including requiring that the alcohol served at their events be provided by a licensed third-party vendor; offering more hazing prevention training; and dedicating Feb. 27 — the day Mr. Oakes, a 19-year-old freshman, was found dead in 2021 — as a day of remembrance for Mr. Oakes, and for hazing prevention.Eric Oakes, his father, said on Monday that “no amount of money is going to bring Adam back.”“As much as we pray to wake up from the nightmare, it just isn’t going to happen,” he said. “The light in all this is that Virginia Commonwealth University is now making changes to prevent what happened to Adam from happening to anyone else in the future.”Mr. Oakes’s father said that the family had not filed a lawsuit against the school. Virginia Commonwealth University said in its statement that it would soon begin the process of creating a memorial to Mr. Oakes on campus.Fraternity organizations have been under intense scrutiny in recent years, after a number of high-profile cases that have drawn the ire of anti-hazing activists and victims’ loved ones who say that the culture of Greek life is dangerous and shrouded in secrecy.According to Mr. Oakes’s family, the young man’s death occurred at an off-campus party at the Delta Chi fraternity house, where he was given a bottle of Jack Daniel’s whiskey and told to drink it.V.C.U. permanently expelled Delta Chi from campus last year, after the university hired a consulting firm to study its Greek culture. The firm, Dyad Strategies, said in a report that while the university’s Greek organizations weren’t an outlier compared with those at other colleges, V.C.U. still struggled to address concerns about binge drinking and hazing.In September last year, 11 people were arrested in connection with Mr. Oakes’s death. His father said that six of them were either found guilty or had pleaded guilty, and that charges had been dropped against the five others.As part of their plea agreements, the six who were convicted will travel to universities across the country to talk about how their actions that night have affected their lives and those of others, Eric Oakes said, and they will do so while sharing the stage with him. He will discuss how his life has been ruined by what the men did or didn’t do that night, he said.“Who better to talk to students than the people their age that, you know, hazed Adam that night,” he said.He added that the family did not want the six men to serve jail time.“We want to make sure this never happens again to another student, family,” he said. “And then not just at V.C.U., but in the entire state and, obviously, the country.”</body>

	<title>Ukraine advances deeper into areas that were held by Russia.</title>
	<author>Marc Santora</author>
	<body>Ukrainian forces have battled their way back into territory in eastern Ukraine, officials said on Tuesday, reclaiming areas lost under months of relentless fire of Russian artillery. It is part of a remarkable turnaround from June, when the Ukrainian Army was nearly out of ammunition and struggled to slow the Russian assault.A Ukrainian official said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces had retaken Bilohorivka, a coal mining village on the banks of the Siversky Donets River that in May was the scene of one of the deadliest engagements of the war for Russian forces.The Ukrainian military was more cautious in declaring victory in Bilohorivka, given that control over towns and villages has proved tenuous in the past. But while only a small village, it would be a potent signal that Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, which along with Donetsk makes up Donbas, the main stated targets of the Kremlin’s war effort.“Our defenders have squeezed the invaders out and are in full control of the town,” Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian military governor of the Luhansk region, said, though he noted that it was still under artillery fire and had largely been razed by the Russians.“There are several towns like this in Luhansk Province,” he said.He had said in earlier comments that there would be “a hard fight for every centimeter of Luhansk land.”In the neighboring region of Donetsk, several Russian war bloggers reported that Ukrainian forces were attacking the strategically important city of Lyman, which also fell to the Russians in May, from two directions.“We have losses,” reported War Gonzo, a Russian military blogger who has more than one million followers. “We hold on and fight with all our might.”Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, said on Monday that Ukrainian forces had gained two footholds on the left bank of the Oskil River, which retreating Russian forces had hoped to use as a natural defensive barrier.Several villages in the Lyman direction are now under the control of the Ukrainian military, he said, and Lyman is in imminent danger of being surrounded.The claims by both the Russians and the Ukrainians — which come after a Ukrainian breakthrough in the northeast this month following months of war — could not be immediately verified, but they both painted a similar picture of Ukrainian advances and were supported by satellite and geolocated war footage.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in his overnight address on Monday, announced efforts to secure recently retaken eastern territory, even as he underlined the importance of continuing to make rapid gains to deny Russia “any foothold on Ukrainian soil.”“The pace is very important now — the pace of stabilization in the liberated areas, the pace of movement of our troops, the pace of restoration of normal life in the liberated territory,” Mr. Zelensky said.An influx of Western weapons has allowed Ukraine to move from defensive to offensive operations, but it remained unclear whether they could sustain their advances as Russian forces regroup and retreat to more heavily fortified defensive positions. Mr. Zelensky said the pace of aid from Ukraine’s Western allies needed to keep up with the speed of Ukraine’s military advance.A senior U.S. defense department official told reporters on Monday that the Pentagon was open to potentially sending Western tanks to Kyiv. And Prime Minister Liz Truss of Britain vowed to continue her country’s military support for Ukraine next year, committing to match this year’s spending of more than $2.6 billion.Ukraine’s military noted that Russia remained focused on taking all of the Donetsk region and keeping control of the territory it has taken. At the same time, Ukrainian officials said Russia had launched missile strikes, airstrikes and rocket attacks across Ukraine, including targeting civilian infrastructure. </body>

	<title>Late Night Recaps the Queen’s Funeral</title>
	<author>Trish Bendix</author>
	<body>Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. Here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.Queen Elizabeth’s funeral took place on Monday, with crowds waiting in line for up to 24 hours to pay their respects.Trevor Noah called the wait “no joke,” saying, “There is no iPhone at the end of that line, all right? It’s just a box and you don’t even get to open the box.”“The line to see the queen’s coffin stretched for miles, similar to what goes on here in America when Popeye’s comes out with a new chicken sandwich.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“The procession was lengthy, with King Charles and siblings walking behind the coffin for nearly one and a half hours. That’s not easy. For years, the royal family’s only form of exercise has been walking back statements from Andrew.” — STEPHEN COLBERT“And it was a three-mile march from Westminster Abbey to Windsor Castle, also known as the long walk. Yeah, or as Kylie Jenner calls it, ‘Why didn’t they take the jet?’” — TREVOR NOAH“Leaders, dignitaries, and politicians from around the world gathered in London for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Trump showed up at a Burger King and said, ‘Sorry for your loss.’” — JIMMY FALLON“In an interview yesterday, President Biden said while we still have a problem with the virus, quote, ‘The pandemic is over.’ Yes. Yeah. But I get why Biden said this. I mean, he just had Covid. Everyone — everyone who gets Covid is over Covid.” — TREVOR NOAH“Biden then announced that skinny jeans, neutral tones, and chrome nail polish are also over.” — JAMES CORDEN“He said ‘the pandemic is over,’ which is weirdly not reassuring at all. It’s like saying ‘Freddy Krueger is dead and he’s never coming back!’” — JIMMY KIMMEL“It’s kind of huge news to mention so casually, you know? I wasn't expecting the end of a two-and-a-half-year nightmare to be announced on the floor of the Detroit Auto Show.” — JIMMY FALLONJimmy Fallon and his “Tonight Show” guest Margot Robbie got blasted in the face with an air cannon for every wrong answer in a guessing game called “Blow Your Mind.”Billy Eichner will talk about his new movie “Bros” on “The Late Show.”After 50 years, “M*A*S*H” holds up as a precursor to modern-day comedies that are more than just funny.</body>

	<title>The Story So Far: Where 6 Investigations Into Donald Trump Stand</title>
	<author>Peter Baker</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — Former President Donald J. Trump has set up his office on the second floor of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida as part replica of the Oval Office and part homage to his time in the real White House.On the wall during a visit last year were six favorite photographs, including ones with Queen Elizabeth II and Kim Jong-un. On display were challenge coins, a plaque commemorating his border wall and a portrait of the former president fashioned out of bullet casings, a present from Jair Bolsonaro, the so-called Trump of Brazil.This has become Mr. Trump’s fortress in exile and his war room, the headquarters for the wide-ranging and rapidly escalating conflict with investigators that has come to consume his post-presidency. It is a multifront war, with battlefields in New York, Georgia and the nation’s capital, featuring a shifting roster of lawyers and a blizzard of allegations of wrongdoing that are hard to keep straight.Never before has a former president faced an array of federal, state and congressional investigations as extensive as Mr. Trump has, the cumulative consequences of a career in business and eventually politics lived on the edge, or perhaps over the edge. Whether it be his misleading business practices or his efforts to overturn a democratic election or his refusal to hand over sensitive government documents that did not belong to him, Mr. Trump’s disparate legal troubles stem from the same sense that rules constraining others did not apply to him.The story of how he got to this point is both historically unique and eminently predictable. Mr. Trump has been fending off investigators and legal troubles for a half century, since the Justice Department sued his family business for racial discrimination and through the myriad inquiries that would follow over the years. He has a remarkable track record of sidestepping the worst outcomes, but even he may now find so many inquiries pointing in his direction that escape is uncertain.His view of the legal system has always been transactional; it is a weapon to be used, either by him or against him, and he has rarely been intimidated by the kinds of subpoenas and affidavits that would chill a less litigious character. On the civil side, he has been involved in thousands of lawsuits with business partners, vendors and others, many of them suing him because he refused to pay his bills.While president, he once explained his view of the legal system to some aides, saying that he would go to court to intimidate adversaries because just threatening to sue was not enough.“When you threaten to sue, they don’t do anything,” Mr. Trump told aides. “They say, ‘Psshh!’” — he waved his hand in the air — “and keep doing what they want. But when you sue them, they go, ‘Oooh!’” — here he made a cringing face — “and they settle. It’s as easy as that.”When he began losing legal battles as president with regularity, he lashed out. At one point when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a traditionally liberal bench based in California, ruled against one of his policies, he demanded that aides get rid of the court altogether. “Let’s just cancel it,” he said, as if it were a campaign event, not a court system established under law. If it required legislation, then draft a bill to “get rid” of the judges, he said, using an expletive.But his aides ignored him and now he finds himself without the power of the presidency, staring at a host of prosecutors and lawyers who have him and his associates in their sights. Some of the issues at hand go back years, but many of the seeds for his current legal jeopardy were planted in those frenetic final days in office when he sought to overturn the will of the voters and hold onto power through a series of lies about election fraud that did not exist.Numerous inquiries. Since leaving office, former President Donald J. Trump has been facing several investigations into his business dealings and political activities. Here is a look at some notable cases:Classified documents inquiry. The F.B.I. searched Mr. Trump’s Florida home as part of the Justice Department’s investigation into his handling of classified materials. The inquiry is focused on documents that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, when he left the White House.Jan. 6 investigations. In a series of public hearings, the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack laid out a comprehensive narrative of Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This evidence could allow federal prosecutors, who are conducting a parallel criminal investigation, to indict Mr. Trump.Georgia election interference case. Fani T. Willis, the Atlanta-area district attorney, has been leading a wide-ranging criminal investigation into the efforts of Mr. Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. This case could pose the most immediate legal peril for the former president and his associates.New York State’s civil case. Letitia James, the New York attorney general, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump and his family business, accusing both of a sweeping pattern of fraudulent business practices. The yearslong investigation has been focused on whether Mr. Trump’s statements about the value of his assets were part of a pattern of fraud or simply Trumpian showmanship.Manhattan criminal case. Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, has been investigating whether Mr. Trump or his family business intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. But the inquiry faded from view after signs emerged suggesting that Mr. Trump was unlikely to be indicted.Many Americans could be forgiven if they have lost the thread of all the investigations amid the blizzard of motions and hearings and rulings of recent weeks. But they essentially break down this way:Long before he became president, by many accounts, Mr. Trump played it fast and loose in business. The question is whether any of that violated the law. For years, according to his own associates, he inflated the value of his various properties to obtain loans.Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, has been examining his business practices for more than three years to determine if they constituted fraud. When she summoned Mr. Trump to testify in a deposition, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to respond to questions on the grounds that his answers might incriminate him more than 400 times.Mr. Trump has assailed Ms. James as a partisan Democrat who is coming after him for political reasons. As a candidate in 2018, she was an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, calling him an “illegitimate president” and suggesting that foreign governments channeled money to his family’s real estate holdings, which she characterized as a “pattern and practice of money laundering.”But Mr. Trump’s lawyers recently sought to settle the case, which could indicate concern about his legal risk, only to have their bid rejected by Ms. James. On Wednesday, she filed a civil lawsuit accusing the former president of fraud.The Manhattan district attorney’s office, now led by Alvin L. Bragg, has looked into some of the same issues as part of a criminal investigation and is about to bring the Trump Organization, the former president’s family business, to trial on charges of fraud and tax evasion starting on Oct. 24.Allen H. Weisselberg, the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has pleaded guilty to 15 felonies, admitting that he conspired with the company to carry out a scheme to avoid paying taxes on lavish perks. Mr. Weisselberg is obliged as part of his plea agreement to testify at the upcoming trial. But Mr. Trump himself is not a defendant, and Mr. Weisselberg has refused to cooperate with the broader investigation.But after Mr. Bragg took office in January, he told the team working the investigation that he was skeptical that they had sufficient evidence to convict Mr. Trump himself. That led to the resignation of the two prosecutors leading the investigation, one of whom said in a resignation letter that the former president was “guilty of numerous felony violations” and that it was “a grave failure of justice” not to hold him accountable.How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.Mr. Trump put himself in possible legal jeopardy in the swing state of Georgia on Jan. 2, 2021, when he called Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, and demanded that he “find 11,780 votes,” just enough to reverse the outcome and take the state away from Joseph R. Biden Jr. During the call, Mr. Trump warned Mr. Raffensperger, a Republican, that he faced a “big risk” if he failed to find those votes, an implied threat the Georgian defied.Mr. Trump’s allies likewise sought to pressure state officials to change the results and, as they did in other key states that went for his opponent, tried to orchestrate a slate of fake electors to send to Washington to cast Electoral College votes for the defeated president instead of Mr. Biden, who won Georgia’s popular vote.Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, has cast a wide net, pressing for testimony by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and informing Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former president’s lawyer, that he is a target of her investigation.Ms. Willis appears to be building a possible case of conspiracy to commit election fraud or racketeering through a coordinated effort to undermine the election. In addition to Mr. Giuliani, multiple allies of the former president have been told they are targets, including the state party chairman and members of the slate of fake electors.Mr. Trump has dismissed Ms. Willis, a Democrat who was elected in the same 2020 balloting that he lost, saying her inquiry is, in the words of a spokesman last year, “simply the Democrats’ latest attempt to score political points by continuing their witch hunt against President Trump.”The House committee investigating the Capitol attack of Jan. 6, 2021, composed of seven Democrats and two Republicans, has done more to lay out a possible criminal case against Mr. Trump in the public space than any of the former president’s pursuers.Its series of hearings over the summer, which could resume on Sept. 28, showcased testimony by Mr. Trump’s own advisers indicating that he was repeatedly informed that the 2020 election was not stolen, that what he was telling the public was not true, that there was no basis to challenge the outcome and even that the crowd he summoned on Jan. 6 included some armed people.The committee documented just how wide-ranging Mr. Trump’s efforts to hold onto power were — how he pressured not just Mr. Raffensperger but officials in multiple states to change the outcomes, how he contemplated declaring martial law and seizing voting machines, how he tried to force the Justice Department to intervene even though he was told there was no case, how he plotted with congressional allies to orchestrate fake electors and ultimately how he sought to strong-arm his own vice president into blocking Mr. Biden’s victory.The committee has no power to prosecute, but it has gone to court to enforce subpoenas to testify and prompted criminal charges of contempt of Congress by the Justice Department against Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Navarro, two former Trump aides. Mr. Bannon has been convicted and is awaiting sentencing, while Mr. Navarro has asked a court to throw out his case.But while lawmakers cannot indict Mr. Trump, they are debating whether to make a criminal referral recommending that the Justice Department do so. That has little substantive meaning, but it would raise the stakes for Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.Mr. Garland remains in some ways the biggest mystery as Mr. Trump seeks to thwart investigators. An even-tempered, widely respected former prosecutor and appellate judge, Mr. Garland has said little to tip his hand, but his department is clearly pursuing multiple strands in its investigation of what happened leading up to and on Jan. 6.The department has interviewed or brought before a grand jury former White House aides like Pat A. Cipollone and Marc Short; seized the phones or electronic devices of Mr. Trump’s allies like John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Mike Lindell, and even a member of Congress; and blitzed out some 40 subpoenas recently to former White House aides like Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino and others close to the former president.After spending much of the last 18 months prosecuting hundreds of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol, Mr. Garland’s team now seems to be examining multiple angles, including the fake electors plan, Mr. Trump’s fund-raising operation as he promoted false claims about election fraud and the former president’s own role in seeking to overturn the election.What remains unclear is if Mr. Garland has a theory of the case yet. While the subpoenas indicated that investigators were looking at, among other things, efforts to “obstruct, influence, impede or delay” the certification of the presidential election, the department has yet to charge people around Mr. Trump and therefore has not laid out any legal conclusions about the actions taken by his camp.One person who is not known to have been subpoenaed yet is Mr. Trump, but it remains a possibility. Bracing for the day the investigators show up on his own doorstep, Mr. Trump has been busy looking for lawyers to represent him since so many of his past attorneys no longer want to be involved with him or face legal trouble of their own.In case Mr. Trump did not expose himself to enough legal trouble in his final days in office, he made decisions as he left the White House that would come back to haunt him as well.The latest threat to the former president stems from his insistence on flying home with thousands of documents owned by the government, including hundreds marked with varying classified designations, and his failure to give them all back when asked.Mr. Garland’s team has indicated in court filings that it is looking at not only criminal charges related to mishandling classified documents but also obstruction of justice. A lawyer for Mr. Trump signed a document stating that he had returned all classified papers in his possession, which proved to be false when F.B.I. agents searched Mar-a-Lago and found boxes of them. Investigators indicated the files were most likely concealed and moved rather than turned over.Mr. Trump’s legal strategy in the papers case mirrors the approach he has often taken over the years — find ways to delay and throw his adversaries off balance. By persuading a federal judge he got confirmed in the last days of his presidency to block investigators from using the retrieved documents while they are examined by a special master, he has hindered prosecutors for now.But that may not last forever. He said this past week that “I can’t imagine being indicted” but conceded that it was “always possible” since prosecutors are “just sick and deranged.” He went on to assert that he declassified the papers he took, even though there is no known record of that.But his real strategy was clear — this is a political battle as much as a legal one, and he warned darkly that there would be “big problems” if he were indicted because his supporters, “I just don’t think they’d stand for it.”Told by the radio host Hugh Hewitt that his critics would interpret that as inciting violence, Mr. Trump said: “That’s not inciting. I’m just saying what my opinion is. I don’t think the people of this country would stand for it.”</body>

	<title>Yvon Chouinard Is the Founder of Patagonia. He’s Also My ‘Dirtbag’ Friend.</title>
	<author>Tom Brokaw</author>
	<body>Yvon Chouinard still possesses, in the proud parlance of the climbing community, the “dirtbag” sensibility. In the 1960s, he lived to climb and made do selling handmade climbing gear so he could devote himself to the mountains.Even today, at the age of 83, when he visits my wife and me in our New York City apartment, he’s likely to spread out his sleeping bag on our sofa when he retires for the night.I know Yvon best as a rock climber, fly fisherman, family man and visionary. With a genius for invention and design, this self-taught blacksmith founded Patagonia, the outdoor clothing retailer, and turned it into a global brand. He had lots of help. The Patagonia staff brought in sophisticated merchandising techniques and new styles to go with old favorites.For decades, Patagonia gave away 1 percent of its sales to environmental causes. Last week, Yvon announced that he, along with his wife and children, had given away the company, valued at $3 billion, to a trust and a nonprofit group. Now the company’s profits of some $100 million a year will be used to fight climate change and safeguard some of the planet’s dwindling wild places.He explained his decision in an open letter: “If we have any hope of a thriving planet — much less a thriving business — 50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have.”Yvon Chouinard has been my friend for 40 years. He has risked my life on many occasions on rambling adventures at the ends of the earth. “Just do what I tell you,” he would assure me. And believe me, I did.Our families are close but have different lifestyles — New York versus the Pacific Coast. But we share common values, especially when it comes to the environment.Yvon and I first met through a mutual friend, Rick Ridgeway, the mountaineer, adventurer and writer who made it to the top of K-2, the world’s second-tallest peak, known as the “savage mountain.”Rick also introduced me to Doug Tompkins, who, like Yvon, had lived a hardscrabble life as a climber (and skier) before also building a fortune as a co-founder, with his first wife, Susie Tompkins Buell, of the retailing giants The North Face and Esprit. Doug and his second wife, Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, used their money to buy and protect more than two million acres of land in the Patagonia region of Chile and Argentina. Like Yvon, Doug had a zealot’s passion for preserving pristine lands and waters.Yvon and Doug were part of a small group of climbers, surfers, skiers and kayakers who called themselves “the Do Boys.” They generously included me in their adventures, but I always put an asterisk after my name. As I once explained, knowing them was and is a privilege.(I did earn my place in the group during a snow white-out on Mount Rainier in Washington State. Doug was about to lead us over a steep cliff when I pulled out my 50-year-old compass and realized we were 180 degrees off course.)They took me places physically and philosophically that I might never have visited otherwise. So much so that I stepped down early from the “NBC Nightly News” so I could spend more time with them.We made the long hauls to Iceland and the wild southern tip of Argentina and Chile. We did winter ski trips in Yellowstone and took fishing excursions to South America.On one of those trips I got up early so I could be ready to go before Yvon geared up. Somehow he arose later and still beat me to the river. (In 2015, Doug died of hypothermia when monster winds flipped his kayak on a Patagonia lake on a Do Boys outing I missed. This was a crushing loss. He always seemed indestructible.)On those excursions, we rarely talked business except about how to make big companies more environmentally responsible. Before we lost him, Doug was a long-playing record on our obligation to the environment. At one point, I said: “I spend my working days documenting environmental failures. If you don’t shut up for a while, I’m walking home.” He laughed that off; we were kayaking at the time in remote wilderness in the Russian Far East.These two self-made men, distrustful of business, approached their singular passion for wild lands in different ways. A 2016 Harvard Business School working paper took note (though well before Yvon’s latest move).“The Chouinard strategy represented best practice green entrepreneurship, which if widely adopted might markedly reduce the environmental impact of business,” according to the analysis. “The Tompkins dual strategy of exit from business and application of entrepreneurial skills to conservation resulted in large environmental gains, including sequestering and storing an estimated 80 million tons of carbon.”Both men were uncomfortable with attention or the routines of others not on their wavelengths. Another way of saying it: They could be cranky.On one trip, I remember a couple of Icelandic businessmen eager to connect to Yvon. He was not much interested, so they said, “Is there anything we can do for you?” He said, “Yeah, can you change my leftover Icelandic money?” And with that, he handed them the equivalent of a dollar in change.Yvon is old-fashioned and has very strong values that he doesn’t hesitate to express. For a long time, I argued that he was too pessimistic. Recently, with the invasion of the coronavirus, the continuing assault on the world’s remaining wild places and the ever-rising temperatures, I have moved sharply in his direction. I have become impatient, too.Even though he had an iconic outdoor clothing business, his personal wardrobe seems to consist of extremely well-worn climbing trousers and an old Patagonia shirt or jacket. When I arranged for him to talk to a gathering of Silicon Valley whiz kids, he let me know he didn’t have a sports jacket.That didn’t keep him from lecturing his audience on their failure to spend more time and money on saving the environment. “Brokaw and I are going to hell for not doing enough,” he told them, “but you still have a chance.”He knows his time is running out on his crusade to save the planet. He’s trying to do his part and he’s impatient with the rest of us.A mutual friend, the writer and sportsman Tom McGuane, calls him “the tiny terror.” With his latest move, Yvon has once again set a gigantic standard for others to consider.Tom Brokaw spent more than a half century as a journalist at NBC News, including 22 years as the anchor of the “NBC Nightly News.” He is the author of numerous books, including “The Greatest Generation.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>1922: Ex-Kaiser to Marry Princess Hermine</title>
	<author>The International Herald Tribune</author>
	<body>DOORN, Tuesday. — The Kaiser has officially contracted an engagement of marriage with Princess Hermine of Schönaich-Caroiath née Princess Ruess.The first official news of the former Kaiser’s engagement reached Paris yesterday in the above telegram to The New York Herald direct from Doorn. Princess Hermine, younger daughter of the late reigning Prince Heinrich XXII of the elder line of the House of Ruess, married Prince Johann, a cadet of the Prussian princely family of Carolath-Beuthen in 1907, and became a widow in 1920. She has three sons and two daughters.According to a message from Berlin, the marriage will probably take place in November. The ex-Kaiser originally intended to announce his engagement towards the end of October, but changed his mind and made the present announcement owing to information published in America. Princess Hermine visited the ex-Kaiser at Doorn last spring and stayed about a week at the castle. Since then she has been in constant correspondence with him. The marriage project has encountered strong opposition from members of the Hohenzollern family and in Monarchist circles of Germany. A deputation, headed by Herr von Oldenburg-Januscha, even went to Doorn to press objections, but met with a warm reply from the former monarch.The “Deutsche Tages Zeitung” indicates that the news of the engagement made a disagreeable impression on the ex-Kaiser’s sons, but that the unpleasantness has been glossed over, and they will be represented at the wedding by the former Crown Prince.— The New York Herald, European Edition, Sept. 20, 1922.</body>

	<title>What Is the Purpose of Teaching U.S. History?</title>
	<author>Jeremy Engle</author>
	<body>Teachers, please note that we have also published a related lesson plan that draws on the same interactive Times feature.How schools teach U.S. history has been the subject of fierce debate in recent years. What do you think students in the United States should learn about their country’s history? Should social studies education focus on the positive accomplishments and contributions the country has made to the world? Or should it reveal the uglier sides of the country’s history, such as persistent racism and economic inequality?In other words, what do you think is the purpose of teaching U.S. history in schools? Is it to foster patriotism? To prepare active and informed citizens? To create change makers? Or something else?In the interactive “What’s Actually Being Taught in History Class,” The Times talked to social studies teachers about what they teach and why. The video below includes some of their responses.The interactive also includes teachers’ perspectives on how the political climate has changed their classrooms:Karalee Wong Nakatsuka, Arcadia, CAlif.I was asked by an administrator to not teach political parties.Catherine Reidenbach, Norfolk, Va.The governor wants you to email if you feel that the teacher is doing a bad job. And it was almost like, ‘What?’Alisha Sanders, Gettysburg, PA.I do oftentimes feel that I have to teach in certain ways to appeal to everyone’s sensitivities.Michael Hjort, Round Rock, TexasWhen you’re going to look at these pieces of legislation, you can find good things and bad things.Students, explore the entire interactive, including the video interviews, then tell us:What do you think should be the purpose of teaching U.S. history in schools? Did reading the interactive and hearing the teachers’ views change your thinking?The text states that since last year, 17 states have imposed laws or rules to limit how race and discrimination can be taught in public school classrooms. How do you feel about that? How have these laws and debates affected your schools, teachers and classrooms?Ms. Sanders says that “there’s a large misunderstanding of what teachers are actually doing in the classroom.” Do you agree? What do you make of fears about the “indoctrination” or “brainwashing” of students?Ms. Nakatsuka says, “It’s the job of a history teacher to tell the full, complex story of U.S. history.” What does that mean to you? Do you think you have learned the “full, complex story of U.S. history”? If not, what do you think has been missing?A law passed in Texas last year said that slavery and racism should be framed as deviations from the country’s founding principles. Greg Abbott, the governor of Texas, who signed the law to ban the teaching of “critical race theory” in the state’s public schools, said “they’re trying to rewrite history and redesign the future of the United States” and “undermining the very values and core of what America stands for.” How persuasive is his argument? Are teachers and educators rewriting history, or is the law rewriting history?Mr. Hjort says that the new Texas law might make “teachers that have felt like their job was to be more activists” aware that they went “too far.” Do you agree? Are laws like the one in Texas good for the teaching and learning of American history? Or will they have a harmful and chilling effect on teachers and classrooms?Tell us about your experiences learning history in and out of school. Do you like history? Is it one of your favorite subjects? Why or why not?Do you think your teachers have done a good job of teaching you history over the years? Have any of your teachers made the past come alive? How could teachers make history more engaging and meaningful to you?Want more writing prompts? You can find all of our questions in our Student Opinion column. Teachers, check out this guide to learn how you can incorporate them into your classroom.Students 13 and older in the United States and Britain, and 16 and older elsewhere, are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.</body>

	<body>MITROVICA, Kosovo — When Europeans and Americans recoiled in horror this spring at evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine, Nebjosa Jovic, a university administrator in northern Kosovo, decided he had to act: He organized a street protest to cheer Russia on.“We wanted to send a message to the West, especially its headquarters in the United States, to stop persecuting Russians,” Mr. Jovic said.Only a few people showed up, Mr. Jovic said, because of the “circle of fear” that envelops northern Kosovo, a mostly ethnic Serb region out of step with the rest of the country, where ethnic Albanians, most of whom strongly support Ukraine, make up more than 90 percent of the population.Viewed from London or Washington, the horrors visited on Ukraine by Russia offer a clear and inescapable moral choice. But, filtered through the prism of grievance and history in places tormented by their own strife, Ukraine’s misery fades in favor of local claims to victimhood.“Russia is the only glimmer of hope we have left,” said Milos Damjanovic, a local historian in the mainly Serb part of the divided city of Mitrovica, in northern Kosovo, and a fervent believer that the West and its NATO military alliance were responsible for the dismemberment of Yugoslavia, of which Kosovo was part until the Balkan wars of the 1990s.On the main road out of Mitrovica to the north — past a guard post manned by American soldiers — a billboard assures local Serbs that they are not standing alone against the West and still have influential friends: It displays pictures of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and the Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic, hailed as “honorary citizens” of a nearby ethnic Serb settlement.Mr. Putin has not shown up to collect his honorary title, but he still figures prominently in the minds of many residents as a potential and much hoped-for savior, the latest in a long line of Russians who, in the Serb accounting of the past, have labored tirelessly to protect their Slavic “brothers” from hostile outsiders, particularly Muslims.Russia fought more than a dozen wars with the Muslim Ottoman Empire, which defeated an Orthodox Christian Serb ruler, Prince Lazar, at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. That ancient reversal bulks large in modern Serb nationalism, feeding a deep well of grievance toward Kosovo’s largely Muslim ethnic Albanian population, even though some Albanians fought on the Serb side.In the center of Mitrovica stand statues honoring Prince Lazar and Grigory Scherbina, a Russian envoy to the region who was killed near the city by a Muslim soldier in 1903. An inscription on the envoy’s statue reads: “A drop of brotherly Russian blood joins the stream of Serbian blood that has been flowing for centuries.”Not mentioned is that the Russian envoy was of Ukrainian origin.History, much of it bloody and dominated by tales of masculine martial valor, looms large across the Balkans, particularly in the celebration — or denunciation — of “brotherly” bonds between Russia and Serbia, both predominantly Orthodox Christian nations.“We have too much history and too much Balkan masculinity,” said Ljiljana Drazevic, who runs a small business weaving woolen shawls. Skeptical that Mr. Putin offered salvation, she said, “People are desperate, but I never had any hope of getting anything from Russia.”Aside from supporting Serbia at the United Nations and giving diplomatic heft to claims that Kosovo still belongs to Serbia, Russia has provided little in the way of concrete aid. And, by repeatedly citing the West’s intervention in Kosovo to justify Russia’s seizure of Crimea and other Ukrainian land, Mr. Putin has undermined the principle of territorial integrity on which Serbia bases its claim to Kosovo.But, said Marko Jaksic, a former local councilor in North Mitrovica, the ethnic Serb part of the city: “When you lose all hope, you believe in miracles. For many people here, Russia is the last hope of protection.”Albin Kurti, the prime minister of Kosovo, a country that most Serbs insist does not exist, lamented that Mr. Putin had become a patron saint for the most intransigent ethnic Serbs. “For extremist groups in Kosovo, Putin is their idol,” Mr. Kurti said in an interview in Pristina, Kosovo’s capital.Most ethnic Serbs, whether living in Serbia or in enclaves in Kosovo and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, view Russia as their friend, not because they necessarily like where Mr. Putin has taken his country but because they loathe NATO. This is particularly pronounced in northern Kosovo, where a 1999 NATO bombing campaign that broke Serbia’s grip on Kosovo is seen as the ultimate source of all the enclave’s problems.Mr. Damjanovic, the historian, said that he would much prefer to live in the “free world,” not in a “world of no rights like Putin’s Russia” but, because of NATO, “We have no choice. Our only choice is Russia.”Before NATO intervened, a storekeeper, who declined to give her name, said that the dark, potholed street outside her shop had been well paved and well lit. She said that she felt sorry for Ukrainians killed by Russian troops but wondered why the West did “not cry for us” during the NATO bombing campaign.Asked by pollsters last year who was “the best defender of Serb interests,” more than 65 percent of residents in northern Kosovo chose Russia and only 3 percent the United States.North Mitrovica’s role as a citadel of pro-Russian sentiment has created a problem for Mr. Vucic, the Serbian president. He has rejected imposing sanctions on Moscow over the invasion, and for years, he has fanned Serbs’ sense of victimhood. At the same time, however, he has labored to convince the West that he is not in the Kremlin’s pocket.For Mr. Vucic, a leader who is trying to get his country into the European Union, ethnic Serbs’ rooting for Russia in a Kosovo region firmly under his thumb is a bad look.Mr. Jovic, the organizer of the pro-Moscow protest, complained that local officials loyal to the Serbian president tightly controlled all political activity in the region and had made it difficult to stage open displays of support for the Kremlin.Mr. Vucic, according to Mr. Jovic, doesn’t want to complicate his already stumbling efforts to join the European Union. “The West,” Mr. Jovic said, “thinks that anyone who supports Russia is a fanatic.”In some cases, that might be true, but for most of Russia’s many fans in northern Kosovo, Moscow simply offers a refuge from feelings of isolation and despair, of which there are a great deal in these parts.Wary of being tarred as extremists and of upsetting Mr. Vucic’s balancing act between East and West, ethnic Serb officials in northern Kosovo offer only muted backing for Russia and deny looking to Moscow for support. “Russia has sympathy here, but we are not seeking any help from it,” said Igor Simic, the deputy head of the main political party representing Serbs in Kosovo.Even Mr. Damjanovic, the anti-NATO historian, conceded that Russia had often disappointed. One example was in June 1999, he said, when Moscow sent troops to Kosovo just hours before NATO forces arrived. Despite receiving an ecstatic welcome from ethnic Serbs waving Russian flags, the Russian forces did nothing to prevent the majority ethnic Albanian population from taking violent revenge after the Serbian police and military left. NATO troops, too, mostly stood aside.But that, Mr. Damjanovic noted, was when Boris N. Yeltsin was in charge of the Kremlin. “Now it is Putin. The stronger Russia is, the better it is for Serbs,” he said. “I don’t know anybody in Kosovo who is supporting Ukraine,” he added, overlooking the near universal support for Ukraine among ethnic Albanians.That so many ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are cheering for Ukraine is enough for many ethnic Serbs to do the opposite.Ethnic Albanians “support Ukraine totally for no real reason, so we all support Russia,” said Milan Dobric, a young Serb artist in northern Mitrovica. “I’m not saying Putin is right to kill Ukrainians, but Russia has its reasons, and I’m totally against NATO.”Milos Milovanovic, a researcher who works at a nongovernmental organization in Mitrovica and who is a rare ethnic Serb critic of Moscow, said, “I personally feel zero sympathy for Russia” in Ukraine. As a result, he noted, “I’m always arguing with my friends.”Hardly anyone in Kosovo, he added, has thought much about the war in Ukraine, but nearly everyone has taken sides “on an emotional level” depending on their ethnicity.“Unfortunately,” Mr. Milovanovic noted, “emotion and rationality do not go together.”</body>

	<title>‘La migración no es un arma para la política’</title>
	<author>Oscar Lopez</author>
	<body>El debate migratorio vuelve a estar al centro de la polémica, una entrevista con Bill Gates y más.Es martes y no hay tiempo que perder. Elda Cantú está de vacaciones y hoy el boletín está a cargo de un invitado, nuestro colega Oscar Lopez, periodista radicado en Ciudad de México.Por Oscar LopezLa inmigración vuelve a acaparar los titulares en Estados Unidos.Los gobernadores republicanos de los estados del sur enviaron a decenas de migrantes a algunos bastiones demócratas del norte, como Washington, Nueva York y Massachusetts. El argumento de los republicanos es que los estados liberales con opiniones progresistas sobre la migración deberían asumir buena parte de la carga económica y política que conlleva la atención de esas personas.El miércoles de la semana pasada, el gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, envió a alrededor de 50 migrantes a la isla de Martha’s Vineyard, en Massachusetts, como parte de un programa de 12 millones de dólares diseñado para transportar a inmigrantes indocumentados a las llamadas “ciudades santuario”.Su llegada inesperada generó caos en la isla, un popular destino vacacional para los ricos y poderosos, incluido el expresidente Barack Obama. En medio de las protestas de los políticos demócratas, los residentes locales se unieron para ofrecerles a los inmigrantes, en su mayoría venezolanos, comida y refugio.Un día después, el gobernador de Texas, Greg Abbott, envió dos autobuses con migrantes a la residencia de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris en Washington. Otras decenas de migrantes llegaron a Nueva York el viernes.Trabajé con un grupo de reporteros en Estados Unidos y Venezuela para reportar las reacciones en América Latina al polémico traslado. Algunas personas —líderes políticos, activistas, gente de a pie y otras— condenaron a los gobernadores republicanos por utilizar a los migrantes como peones políticos.“La migración no es un arma para la política”, dijo Karmen Ramírez Boscán, congresista colombiana.Mis colegas en Venezuela hablaron con las familias de los migrantes que han emprendido el viaje hacia el norte, muchos de ellos por la peligrosa ruta del Tapón del Darién. Conversar con ellos da un panorama de la terrible situación en el país que ha hecho que tantas personas decidan arriesgarse a emprender esa odisea.“Los venezolanos estamos sufriendo mucho como para que nos traten de esa manera”, dijo una mujer cuya hija partió recientemente desde Maracaibo, en el occidente de Venezuela, hacia Estados Unidos.Si alguien te reenvió este correo, puedes hacer clic aquí para recibirlo tres veces por semana.Volveremos el viernes. Si te gustó este boletín, compártelo con tus amigos, colegas y seres queridos (y no tan queridos). Y por favor, cuéntanos qué te parece.</body>

	<title>Jenny Xie Explores the Subversive Power of the Concealed and the Overlooked</title>
	<author>Han Zhang</author>
	<body>The poet Jenny Xie was exploring the library stacks at the Shanghai campus of N.Y.U., where she was on a fellowship, when a book with a bright red cover caught her eye. In it, she found hundreds of photos of China’s Cultural Revolution.The images, taken by Li Zhensheng during the dramatic, often violent period of upheaval that gripped China between 1966 and 1976, had been clandestinely preserved until their U.S. publication. Xie devoured the book in one sitting.Born in Anhui Province, in eastern China, she had moved to the United States to join her parents when she was around 4 years old. The photographs, she said, provided a window into a past shared by generations of Chinese people, including many in her family, and of which she’d seen little visual documentation.“Suddenly, there is this opening into the past of people I love,” Xie said recently in a garden in Greenwich Village. The photography, she said, “made me think about how deeply strange it was that I have no visual understanding of what so many people in my family lived through.”The connection she felt with the images reverberated. Xie is a sight-oriented poet. Her debut collection, titled “Eye Level,” won the 2017 Walt Whitman Award and is a feast of scenery: Phnom Penh’s rain-slicked tin roofs, Corfu’s white sailboats lining up like “grains of rice.” It is also preoccupied with the ethics of seeing: a viewfinder “slices the horizon,” a camera “neuters the present” and to bestow one’s gaze is to spend “a soft currency.”Not long after Xie returned to New York, the pandemic started. Cloistered in her apartment, she returned to Li’s photos often — her own copy of the book became a sort of a portal, she said, connecting the past to the present.Looking at scenes in which people considered “class enemies” were humiliated and sometimes tortured in front of an audience, known as “struggle sessions,” she’d focus on specific people in the crowd and wonder what had happened to them. Over time, this obsession, along with snippets of her 2019 stay in China and other memories, became fodder for a new collection, “The Rupture Tense,” to be released by Graywolf on Tuesday and already on the longlist for the National Book Award for poetry.In the book, the poet not only peeks at her family’s past and their country’s history, but also explores the subversive power to be found in examining what has been concealed or overlooked: Li’s long-hidden archive, the older generations’ silence about the past, and the unexamined trauma that goes on shaping how family members relate to one another.Nearly half a century after the end of the Cultural Revolution, discussion of the period is still largely muffled in public and private spaces in China. Overseas, however, the works of documentarians and novelists, such as Yang Jisheng (who, like Li, was a state news reporter) and Ma Jian, preserve the records and explore the legacy of the era.“The Cultural Revolution was like a surreal nightmare. It’s a wake-up call today to read Jenny Xie,” the poet and novelist Qiu Xiaolong, who was a teenager in Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution, wrote in an email. “In poetics, she chooses a uniquely working form, controlled language, to mold these inhuman experiences into an organic whole.”Xie is not the only one who stares into this abyss, but her processing of the experience is particularly evocative. Xie’s lines have an unmooring effect: She slyly dissects images and concepts, rearranging the landmarks of the mind. Tracy K. Smith, who taught Xie more than a decade ago, appreciates her deftness.“It is a marvelous and subtle use of metaphor that does the emotional or even the spiritual work in her poems,” Smith wrote in an email. “Metaphor bears witness to the feeling that the tools and terms we have been taught to rely upon are never enough.”The four sections of “The Rupture Tense” oscillate between the past and the present. In the first section, a handful of short poems focus on Li’s photographs; the blocks of text, confined on the page, appear like epigraphs. The brutalization described varies: At a “struggle session,” “a man’s character, stripped down to what he owns, yields to plain sight”; at one winter execution, there are “eight stripped trees matching eight individuals on their knees.”In these photos, Xie looks for such striking, small details, which, she said, “pierce us, that bruise us, that pull us into having an emotional relationship with a photograph.”Smith wrote, “Under Jenny’s gaze, the Cultural Revolution, which has always been framed as a phenomenon contained to a specific place and a specific time, shakes free of that framework, revealing itself to be on intimate terms with this place (America) and this time (now).”Shortly after Xie was born, her father was accepted into a Ph.D. program in mathematics at Rutgers University. His wife and daughter eventually joined him in New Jersey. Around age 7, Xie became nearsighted. Eyesight has been a source of anxiety in the family, she said; many members have impaired vision and one of Xie’s grandmothers became blind after an ocular hemorrhage.“My parents always sort of instilled in me a fear that my vision was imperiled,” she said, “reading in low light, watching TV, these sources of pleasure were always bound up in the fear that I could lose my eyesight.”Her fascination with physical vision extends to the interpretation of what is seen: She thinks about how a sight is “constructed and enabled and reinforced” by its context.“There are consequences to how we see, what we see, and also what we allow to remain unseen,” she said.A line in one of the opening pages explores the power inherent in seeing and the urge to avert one’s eyes: Speaking of the soon-to-be-executed figures in a pair of photographs taken of the same scene from different angles, she writes: “Close the book, they disappear. Open it and they’re upright again.”When she was growing up, Xie said, stories about this era were a closed book. “A lot of things remained hidden by people who became accustomed to living inside these dense silences.”In 2019, she visited her parents’ hometowns, Hefei and Wuhu, in Anhui. Wuhu is also her birthplace. At 4, when she left, Xie had been too young to have formed a sense of self in this setting, she said. But some sensory impressions rushed back and felt familiar, if not familial.An eponymous poem, “The Rupture Tense,” probes the conflicted feelings of a returnee. One childhood memory relived: “tin bowls of braised river snails” and “the needlehead pulls from the shell.” Another recognition: “Cab driver, pointer finger in a pot of Tiger Balm/dabbing on the temples and nasal septum for that sting of wakefulness,/cutting through the edgeless fog of wage labor.”Beyond the evocative sensations and sweet reunions, Xie finds ambivalence in the experience of returning — what the poem calls “a kind of withdrawal by reentering.” Categories of identity — Chinese, American and Chinese American — are lines she tries to blur rather than solidify, she said; on that trip, however, she felt especially American.“Both my Chinese relatives and I lived inside a kind of sustaining fiction, in terms of how we thought of one another,” she said. “I was also interested in interrogating the ways in which I imputed certain beliefs and desires onto them and they onto me.”Sometimes she tried to inquire about the Cultural Revolution, she said. The fact that she is a writer and an outsider made the relatives a bit uneasy. She understands. She sees the same reticence in her parents, who have long been settled in the United States. In their reactions, she detects “the aftershocks of that era, and the ways in which they become inscribed in the behaviors of the people who lived through them.”In China, the silence was still enforced. In her writing, she tries to trace it to its source.“If they’ve jotted down lines of verse, I’ll never see them,” she writes. She writes of “VPNs, coded chats” — the reality of online communication in contemporary China, haunted by “the bitten and erratic ghosts” of the past. She laments for “a kind of collective disfigurement that never goes corrected.”In addition to the river snails and the silences, Xie saw the decaying of the older generations in her family.“It made me consider the passage of time, the scale of time, and also mortality,” she said.Li, the photographer, died in New York in 2020. Upon hearing the news, Xie sat down and wrote a poem in his memory. In it, her description of how memories work — “coded into cells to cross-pollinate with other images in the mind” — seems to gesture to the future, where a reader might feel pierced by her words and go interrogate the past.</body>

	<title>Protests Erupt in Iranian Cities After Woman’s Death in Custody</title>
	<author>Farnaz Fassihi</author>
	<body>Antigovernment protests erupted in cities across Iran on Monday in response to a young woman’s death in the custody of the country’s morality police, with security forces firing on crowds in the northwest and killing four men, according to three Iran-focused human rights organizations.The demonstrations, led mostly by women, broke out in more than a dozen cities and on university campuses in Tehran. They were prompted by the death on Friday of Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been arrested three days earlier in Tehran for allegedly violating Iran’s hijab law, which requires women to cover their hair and wear loosefitting robes.Women protesting on Monday took their head scarves off and waved them in defiance. In Tehran, men and women chanted “we will fight and take our country back,” including students on campuses where fear of arrests, which can lead to a lifetime ban from higher education, has kept a lid on dissent for at least a year. Security forces in the capital fired gunshots and water cannons, chased protesters and beat them with batons, according to videos shared on social media by Iranian journalists. In Ms. Amini’s home province in the northwest, Kurdistan, where protests have been brewing since her funeral on Saturday, four men in three cities were shot and killed, said the Kurdistan Human Rights Group, which posted their names and photos online. Eighty-five other people were injured, including three children, and 200 were arrested, according to the rights group.In at least a dozen cities in Kurdistan Province, most shops closed after opposition Kurdish political groups issued a joint call for strikes, rights groups said.“We are witnessing a nationwide reaction, really like a George Floyd moment for the national conscience that can no longer bear the violence and the logic of the ruling class in killing ordinary citizens,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group.Like previous waves of nationwide protests in Iran, the demonstrations were set off by a specific event — Ms. Amini’s death — but quickly broadened to take up a long litany of grievances, with crowds calling for an end to the Islamic Republic, according to videos shared by Iranian journalists.The protests reflected the built-up frustration of many Iranians struggling under oppressive rules and economic hardship, with little hope of meaningful change. In the past, such widespread antigovernment unrest has been crushed, with large deployments of security forces killing, injuring and arresting protesters.Ms. Amini’s death sparked outrage across social, religious and political factions. Even senior clerics and other supporters of the government called for the abolition of the morality police and condemned the government for deploying violence as a means of enforcing religious rules.The morality police have said that Ms. Amini died from a heart attack, denying accusations that she had suffered blows to the head while being taken to a detention facility in a van. Ms. Amini’s family members have told news outlets that she was perfectly healthy; that security officials had not shared her autopsy report with them; and that officials had pressured the family to bury her in the middle of the night and to stay quiet about her death.Many of the demonstrations on Monday targeted the heart of the regime: the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Protesters chanted for his death and the downfall of his son Mojtaba, seen as a potential successor, according to videos posted on social media and on BBC’s Persian news service.In the northern city of Rasht, protesters took over a street, chanting “death to the dictator” and “death to the oppressor, be it the shah or the supreme leader.” Several women ripped off and burned their head coverings to protest the hijab law, videos posted to social media and BBC Persian showed. Police forces responded by firing tear gas.Mr. Khamenei has been ill in recent weeks, according to people familiar with his condition. He made an appearance at his residential compound on Saturday for a religious ceremony, but spoke only briefly, in a hushed and shaky voice.Iranian media reported that President Ebrahim Raisi had ordered an investigation into Ms. Amini’s death and had called her father to offer condolences. Mr. Raisi arrived in New York on Monday for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations, where he is scheduled to deliver a speech on Wednesday. On Twitter, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken called on Iran to “end its systemic persecution of women and to allow peaceful protest,” adding that the United States mourned Ms. Amini  along with the Iranian people.Grand Ayatollah Asadollah Bayat-Zanjani, a major Shia religious leader in the holy city of Qom, condemned the security forces’ actions leading up to Ms. Amini’s death, saying they were “against the law, against religion and against logic.” Iran’s main reformist political party, Hezb-i Etemad-i Melli, issued a statement calling for an end to the morality police and demanding that Iran’s Parliament repeal the hijab law, a first for a political group within Iran.But Roya Boroumand, the executive director of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, a Washington-based advocacy group focused on human rights in Iran, said it was unlikely that the law, or the morality police, would be abolished.“Hijab is the signature of the revolution,” Ms. Boroumand said. “It is what sets Iran apart from other Muslim nations and it is the means of terrorizing the population — women — without a cause.”</body>

	<title>An Anti-E.S.G. Activist Takes on Apple and Disney</title>
	<author>Ephrat Livni</author>
	<body>A conservative investor, with backing from Peter Thiel and Bill Ackman, has two new targets in his anti-E.S.G. campaign. Yesterday, Vivek Ramaswamy sent letters to the C.E.O.s of Apple and Disney, urging them to refrain from making political statements on behalf of their companies, or hiring decisions based on race, sex or political beliefs.Ramaswamy has emerged as one of Wall Street’s most prominent critics of the environmental, social and governance investing movement. Earlier this year, the investor, who is the author of “Woke, Inc.,” launched Strive Asset Management, which he says will combat pressure on companies to consider liberal politics before bottom lines. Its first exchange-traded fund, which is focused on energy, launched last month and already has roughly $320 million in assets. Its ticker symbol, which echoes Ramaswamy’s prescription for the energy industry, is DRLL.Strive’s second fund, the Strive 500 E.T.F., which invests in large public companies, launches today. Ramaswamy’s plan is to use the power of shareholder votes to refocus large companies on maximizing profit, a goal from which Ramaswamy says boardrooms have strayed. One of the first issues it’s tackling is hiring policies; Apple, Ramaswamy says, is a prime example of the problem.Ramaswamy is urging Apple to halt its “racial equity audit” and to remove diversity considerations from its hiring and compensation policies. His letter hints that if Apple doesn’t change its policies, Strive will try to raise the issue at its next shareholder meeting. In his letter to Disney, Ramaswamy says the company has hurt its brand by speaking out against government policies that do not directly affect its business, namely Florida’s recent law that limits the discussion of sexuality and gender in the classroom. “We would be best served to have an honest debate about why we need E.S.G.,” Ramaswamy told DealBook. “You can make the argument that companies have a social responsibility that goes above and beyond profits, but to retrofit E.S.G. to say that it’s about long-term profit maximization, well, that glove doesn’t fit.”It’s part of a growing debate over the influence of E.S.G. investors. Critics say the managers of such funds are limiting companies’ profits and ability to compete. E.S.G. proponents say looking at the long-term impact of corporate decisions on the environment and society might sacrifice short-term gains, but will lead to higher profits and more sustainable firms. In an essay this weekend, Martin Lipton, the prominent corporate attorney and founding partner of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, argued that companies have a legal responsibility to consider those longer-term questions. “We continue to believe it is essential that boards operate under a governance model that permits consideration of E.S.G. principles and sustainable investment strategies,” he wrote. Chamath Palihapitiya winds down two of his SPACs. The financier said this morning that he would return their funds to investors, after failing to find suitable merger targets for either. Palihapitiya, who became a serial SPAC mogul during the pandemic, said he considers such funds “just one of many tools” to invest.Supply-chain issues cost Ford dearly. Shares in the carmaker were down nearly 5 percent premarket after it said it would pay $1 billion more for parts this quarter. Ford blamed inflation and shortages.New York City faces a fiscal crisis. City officials expect tax revenue — including from businesses and personal income taxes — to drop, leading to what New York State’s comptroller estimates will be a $10 billion budget shortfall in 2026. That could result in drastic reductions in city services, including garbage pickups and policing.House Republicans reportedly consider investigating the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. G.O.P. lawmakers may begin inquiries into the lobbying group and some of its largest members if they retake the House this fall, according to The Intercept. Behind the drive: Republican opposition to the Chamber’s support for E.S.G.The Biden administration’s bid to block a UnitedHealth deal is denied. A federal judge rejected the Justice Department’s lawsuit to prevent the health insurer from buying Change Healthcare. It was the latest setback for the administration’s more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement.Therabody, the maker of the Theragun hand-held massage device, a cult favorite among athletes, has raised $165 million, DealBook is first to report. The fund-raising round, which was led by the private equity firm North Castle Partners, comes as wellness businesses seek to regain their footing as the pandemic recedes.During the height of the pandemic, money poured into home fitness. Sales of Peloton and Tonal workout equipment skyrocketed. While companies like Peloton are scaling back as demand falters, Therabody’s C.E.O., Benjamin Nazarian, says the pandemic highlighted a need to take care of your body. “Whether it’s a recession or not, your body is the most valuable thing you have in your life,” he said. Last year, Therabody’s revenues reached $396 million, up from $224 million in 2020.Executives did not disclose the valuation of the latest fund-raising round. “The idea of having products for recovery in your home — we still think is a fairly young concept,” said Jon Canarick, a managing partner at North Castle, whose investments include Barry’s Bootcamp and HydroMassage.Theragun will use the money to invest in digital content and acquisitions. It’s also announcing eight new products today, including smart goggles to help relieve facial tension and headaches as well as a new mini Theragun. The financing includes investment from a broad array of celebrities, including the comedian Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat Ventures and the model Karlie Kloss. “I had been a consumer and a superfan for a while,” Kloss told DealBook. She did not disclose the size of her investment.Fending off copycats will be key. Therabody has settled with more than 15 companies over I.P. infringement. Still, it continues to see competitors offering massage guns cheaper than its $400 Theragun Elite. People “think that the low price point is going to take the entire market — and that is probably a very naïve understanding of I would say any consumer business,” Nazarian told DealBook. “Tell me one industry where there is no premium brand.”A Canadian lithium mine owned by the Australian company Sayona Mining could produce the raw materials needed to advance the Biden administration’s climate goals and rival China’s dominance of the battery supply chain. If it opens on schedule early next year, it will be the second North American source of lithium. But the mine has had several owners, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, and mining the materials needed for electric vehicles is an arduous process, writes The Times’s Jack Ewing.The price of lithium has soared fivefold since mid-2021, pushing the cost of electric vehicles out of reach for many drivers. (Last year, the average new electric car in the U.S. cost about $66,000 — just a few thousand dollars less than the median household income.) Dozens of lithium mines are in various stages of development in North America, and Canada is determined to become a major source of raw materials and components for E.V.s. But most projects are years from production. Even if they raise the billions of dollars needed to get going, there is no guarantee they will yield enough lithium to meet the continent’s needs.The stakes are rising for the auto industry. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed in August, provides incentives and subsidies for car buyers and automakers. But to qualify for the savings, which are worth a total of $10,000 or more per electric vehicle, battery makers must use raw materials from North America or a country with which the U.S. has a trade agreement. Whether there will be enough lithium to meet soaring demand for electric vehicles is another question. “Those of us in the industry are quite confident that lithium will be in short supply for the next decade,” said Keith Phillips, chief executive of Piedmont Lithium, which owns 25 percent of the Sayona’s Quebec project. He added, “Others are taking a contrarian view.”— Mark Russell, the outgoing C.E.O. of the electric vehicle maker Nikola, testifying at the securities fraud trial of the company’s founder, Trevor Milton. Russell said he opposed Milton becoming executive chairman and maintaining power.The rout in metaverse stocks is having a tangible effect on shareholders big and small. Exhibit A: Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Meta, has seen his personal fortune shrink by $71 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tech is one of the worst-performing sectors on the S&amp;P 500 this year, and within that blur of red is the smaller subset of so-called metaverse stocks, or tech companies that are building virtual worlds for gaming, socializing and work. The investor Cathie Wood and Goldman Sachs were among those who heralded the metaverse as the biggest breakthrough in consumer tech since the introduction of the iPhone.

	<title>Lesson Plan: Using Statistics to Understand Extreme Heat</title>
	<author>Taylor Kockenmeister</author>
	<body>Featured Article: “Climate Change Fuels Heat Wave in India and Pakistan, Scientists Find” by Henry FountainExtraordinary heat blanketed the globe this summer: The United States, Spain, France and China, among other countries, all experienced record-breaking temperatures much earlier in the year than usual.Scientists now have no doubt that climate change is making extreme heat more common worldwide. While more research is needed to determine whether this summer’s heat waves were made more likely or more intense because of human activity, a team of researchers who studied the severe spring heat in India and Pakistan found that human-induced warming made the heat wave hotter and much more likely to occur.Why? There are a number of factors at play, but one has to do with the relationship between averages and extremes. In this lesson, you’ll read more about the heat wave and then make box-and-whisker plots (also known as box plots) to investigate how new extremes have big implications for median and mean temperatures. You’ll also explore the effects that heat waves like this one have on local communities and the rest of the world.Take a close look at this graph, which was originally published in The Times in 2017:Then respond to the following questions in writing or a class discussion:What do you notice?What do you wonder?What is one sentence you can use to summarize the data in the graph?Read the article, then answer the following questions:1. By how much has the chance of such a heat wave occurring increased since the 19th century? If climate change continues at the same rate, and the world reaches 2 degrees Celsius of warming, what will this probability increase to?2. What are some of the repercussions of the prolonged heat in India and Pakistan?3. South Asia often experiences extreme temperatures. What was so concerning about this particular heat wave?4. The article says that the effects of heat waves, like this one, “tend to fall disproportionately on the poor.” What does that mean? Give one example.5. Why are scientists now certain that climate change and heat waves are connected?6. What is your reaction to the data presented in this article? Explain.Now, let’s use statistics to better understand why the extreme heat that India and Pakistan experienced is becoming more likely. We’ll make box-and-whisker plots — which make it easy to visualize the median and the upper and lower extremes of a data set — to compare temperature data from March 2012 to that from March 2022 in one city in India: New Delhi.Example: Take a look at the following example. The table below shows weather data from New Delhi from March 2012. First, the temperatures were put into ascending order to identify the upper and lower extremes, the median and the upper and lower quartiles. Then, the mean was calculated by adding together all the temperatures and dividing them by the number of data points. Finally, a box-and-whisker plot was created based on the data.Maximum Temperatures in New Delhi, March 2012Respond to the following questions in a class discussion or in your journal:Study the box-and-whisker plot closely. What do you notice? What do you wonder?Examine each of the quartiles. What do they reveal about the data?What do you notice about the relationship between the median and the mean? What does it tell you about the data?You try: The table below shows weather data from New Delhi from March of 2022. Create a box-and-whisker plot for this set of data by identifying the upper and lower extremes, the median and the upper and lower quartiles. Additionally, calculate the mean by adding together all the temperatures and dividing them by the number of data points. You can draw a box-and-whisker plot using a number line or create one online using a box-plot generator. (You can find more detailed instructions here from Khan Academy.)Maximum Temperatures in New Delhi, March 2022Discuss and reflect: Once you’ve finished creating your box-and-whisker plot, answer the following questions in writing or in a class discussion:Compare your box plot to the example box plot. Look closely at the median, extremes and upper and lower quartiles. How have they changed between 2012 and 2022?How does the mean help you to better understand the data? How do the mean temperatures from 2012 and 2022 compare?How does this activity help explain why extreme heat may be becoming hotter and more frequent?How do the article and math activity help you understand why people are worried about heat waves, like the one that scorched India and Pakistan this spring? How might they affect local communities and the world?Answer key for math activityLearn more about extreme heat with these activities and resources:How might you be able to use the same box-and-whisker plot activity for where you live or another part of the world? Look up weather data for a location and then use that data to create a box plot and analyze what is happening there.In “This Is Inequity at the Boiling Point,” Somini Sengupta writes: “A hotter planet does not hurt equally. If you’re poor and marginalized, you’re likely to be much more vulnerable to extreme heat.” Read the article, and then discuss your thoughts on this reality with your classmates. How might heat waves affect people in your community in different ways?Who should bear the responsibility for climate change? Listen to the July episode of “The Daily,” titled “Broken Climate Pledges and Europe’s Heat Waves.” How will these broken climate pledges worsen the effects of heat waves around the globe?How much hotter is your hometown than when you were born? Use this interactive graph, originally published in 2018, to find out how your hometown has changed so far and how much hotter it may get.Find more lesson plans and teaching ideas here.</body>

	<title>Buldak, the Fiery Korean Chicken Dish, Gets the Pizza Treatment</title>
	<author>J. Kenji López-Alt</author>
	<body>Buldak, or “fire chicken,” is a modern Korean dish known for its intense spiciness thanks to a sweet marinade heavy on chile paste and pepper flakes. The chicken can be cooked in a number of ways — on a grill or fried, for example — before it’s broiled with a bubbly and browned blanket of mozzarella. It’s a great drinking food.After trying a half-dozen recipes for buldak earlier this summer, it occurred to me that the flavors in it — a spicy-sweet sauce, smoky chicken, melted mozzarella — are similar to the flavors of barbecue chicken pizza. But how would a buldak pizza taste? Both buldak and pizza are drinking, or anju, foods, so a mash-up seemed natural to me.For my initial tests, I used my go-to New York pizza dough recipe as it works well, both in a conventional oven, with a pizza stone or steel, or in a specialized outdoor pizza oven.I was pretty sure that simply placing buldak on top of pizza dough and baking it would need some tweaking, but I tried it all the same, using this very simple recipe from Emily Kim (a.k.a. YouTube’s Maangchi) that is fast to make and has a really nice sweet-hot balance.Her recipe stews chicken breast on the stovetop in the chile marinade. I spread that cooked chicken (along with excess marinade) onto a stretched round of dough and topped it with cheese, then baked it on top of a pizza steel inside of a preheated 550 degree oven until the crust was nicely crisped and the cheese was browned and bubbly. Chopped scallions (in lieu of the red onions that top barbecue chicken pizza) and sesame seeds provided the finish.In pizza form, the chicken was as deliciously spicy as I’d expect, but what had been a nice counterbalancing sweetness in the original dish came off as cloying on the pizza. It was as if the sugar had reduced and caramelized too far while the pizza baked — the way grocery store barbecue sauce can turn your chicken candy-sweet if applied too thickly. Moreover, the chicken breast was overcooked by the time the pizza was done.Sasha Marx, in his buldak recipe on Serious Eats, mellows the sauce by sautéing the garlic and ginger before adding the remaining ingredients. This worked well for me, too, though I skipped his suggestion of adding Sprite because of the sweetness issue. It took a few iterations, but I solved the problem by dividing the sauce, using half as a marinade for the chicken and diluting the other half with crushed tomatoes and stock. The added savory flavors pulled the sweetness back to more reasonable levels.The high heat required for pizza meant I could char the chicken, though I’d need to be careful about overcooking it. I switched to chicken thighs which, because of their higher levels of connective tissue and fat, are less prone to overcooking than chicken breast. Overcooked chicken tastes dry because muscle proteins react to heat by contracting, which in turn squeezes out juices. In an overnight marinade or brine, salt will break down these muscle proteins, effectively safeguarding your chicken from overcooking. Since I was making pizza dough that ferments overnight in the fridge, adding an overnight marinating step was a no-brainer.Spread on a rimmed baking sheet and placed directly on my pizza steel in the hot oven, the chicken thigh pieces developed a smoky char and were cooked through in 7 to 8 minutes. I cooled the chicken fully before chopping it into pieces, which gave me time to stretch my proofed and rested pizza dough and get my topping station ready.This time the chicken was tender and moist throughout, with little bits of smoky char. But even with the changes I’d made to the buldak, the pizza tasted a little incomplete to me. It lacked the acidity needed to balance out the cheese and crust. I opened the fridge and fished around until I found a jar of quick-pickled Fresno chiles. Along with some slices of fresh garlic sprinkled on just before baking, the pickled chiles were exactly what the pizza needed.To be certain, I made another pizza, this time with a different pickled chile from my fridge on each quadrant (banana peppers, pickled jalapeños, pepperoncini and pickled Thai chiles). They all worked equally well.I couldn’t help but wonder if another pizza style might be superior for these flavors, so I made buldak pizza in a wide range of styles. It turns out New York is my overall favorite, but there were some other interesting versions that you might want to try for yourself.Thin-crust bar-style buldak pizza is fantastic, especially cut into party squares and served with beer. Neapolitan crust can’t support heavy toppings like chunky chicken. French bread buldak pizza eats like a deliciously spicy open-faced chicken Parm. Detroit-style buldak pizza has potential, but my version of it was far too heavy and would need tweaking. Does Chicago deep dish buldak pizza sound delicious to you? Whatever your answer, that’s exactly how it tastes. Tortilla-crust buldak pizza, made by crisping up a topped tortilla in a skillet and finishing it under the broiler, is universally delicious and should be in everyone’s late-night arsenal.Recipe: Buldak Pizza (Korean Fire Chicken Pizza)Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest. Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice.</body>

	<title>Erdogan says Russia should return all captured Ukrainian territory.</title>
	<author>Carlotta Gall</author>
	<body>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey said on Monday that Russia should return all Ukrainian territory it has captured, and indicated that negotiations that he has been helping mediate are moving in that direction.“The lands which were invaded will be returned to Ukraine,” Mr. Erdogan said in an interview with “PBS NewsHour.” He was careful not to criticize President Vladimir V. Putin over his conduct of the war, but drew a clear line on the return of territory.“This is what is expected,” Mr. Erdogan said. “This is what is wanted. Putin has taken certain steps. We have taken certain steps.”“An invasion cannot be justified,” he added.Mr. Erdogan has positioned himself as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia and hosted preliminary peace talks in Istanbul in March, although those discussions were inconclusive. In the interview, Mr. Erdogan suggested that Moscow and Kyiv may be close to reaching an agreement to exchange 200 “hostages,” which would be one of the largest prisoner swaps in the seven-month war.“Two hundred hostages will be exchanged upon agreement between the parties. I think a significant step will be taken forward,” he said, providing no further details.Ukraine and Russia agreed on a prisoner swap in late June that saw 144 Ukrainians exchanged, most of them fighters from the Azovstal steel factory in Mariupol.News of the possible exchange came soon after Mr. Putin met with Mr. Erdogan last week in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to discuss the war. Mr. Erdogan said the meeting gave him the impression that “he’s willing to end this as soon as possible.”“This is a conflict that ended up in casualties,” Mr. Erdogan said. “The people are dying, and nobody will be winning at the end of the day.” Mr. Erdogan also expressed opposition to the annexation of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia seized in 2014. He said he had repeatedly asked Moscow to “return Crimea to its rightful owners,” without result.The relationship between the two autocrats has grown closer in recent years, defined by the fluctuating power dynamics and mutual interests. Turkey has opposed Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, but Mr. Erdogan has sought to maintain a close relationship with Mr. Putin, trying to mitigate the fallout in Turkey of the Ukraine war as he heads into an election year with his country’s economy imploding.He has refused to apply Western economic sanctions against Russia’s industry and broader economy and mediated a deal to allow grain exports out of Ukraine. The two leaders have met several times to discuss expanding their diplomatic partnership and to negotiate economic cooperation.Mr. Erdogan’s comments came after fighting erupted last week on the border of Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave at the center of a decades-long conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia — with Turkey supporting Azerbaijan and Russia having intervened to save Armenia. The deadly clashes have raised the prospect of Russia’s losing influence after Moscow moved some of its troops from the south Caucasus to Ukraine. </body>

	<title>On Anniversary of Hurricane Maria, Storm Leaves Puerto Rico in the Dark</title>
	<author>Patricia Mazzei</author>
	<body>SALINAS, P.R. — Hurricane Fiona deluged Puerto Rico with unrelenting rain and terrifying flash floods on Monday, forcing harrowing home rescues and making it difficult for power crews to reach many parts of the island.Now the island is once again in darkness, five years after Hurricane Maria inflicted more damage on Puerto Rico than any other disaster in recent history.While Fiona will be the direct culprit, Puerto Ricans will also blame years of power disruptions, the result of an agonizingly slow effort to finally give the island a stable grid. Hurricane Maria, a near-Category 5 storm, hit on Sept. 20, 2017, leaving about 3,000 dead and damaging 80 percent of the system. The last house was not reconnected to the system until nearly a year later. Hurricane Fiona, with far less ferocious winds, is the strongest storm to reach the island since.Its copious rains on Sunday and Monday — more than 30 inches in some areas in southern Puerto Rico and its central mountainous region — caused the island’s vast lattice of canals and creeks to swell, turned entire streets into muddy rivers and forced the rescues of more than 1,000 people. At least one person died, while operating a generator, while another death was recorded in the Dominican Republic.“I’ve never seen this in my life, not even in Maria,” said Ada Belmot Plaza, who had to be rescued by the Puerto Rico National Guard as waist-high floodwaters rose outside her daughter’s house in the El Coquí neighborhood of Salinas, on Puerto Rico’s southern coast.Some Puerto Ricans said Hurricane Fiona took them by surprise, and many in the hardest-hit areas were still waiting for government help on Monday as neighbors came together to clear fallen trees from roads and remove debris from homes. Gov. Pedro R. Pierluisi urged people to stay indoors. He said he expected most electricity to be back up “in a matter of days.” By Monday morning, power had been restored to some 100,000 customers, out of 1.5 million.The federal government paid $3.2 billion to patch up the island’s electrical grid in Hurricane Maria’s wake. But that was just to get the power back on; Congress earmarked an additional $10 billion to modernize the antiquated and inefficient system.The Puerto Rico government and the fiscal board appointed by Congress to oversee the island’s finances required that the power transmission and distribution system be privatized after deeming the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which is bankrupt but continues to run power generation, to be ineffective. Funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency will finance any new upgrades.In 2020, Puerto Rico awarded a 15-year contract to LUMA Energy, a private Canadian-American consortium, for a fixed annual fee of $115 million. After taking over in June of last year, the company quickly struggled with rolling summer blackouts. There was an islandwide outage in April, with no bad weather in sight.And so, in the wake of Hurricane Fiona, most Puerto Ricans face the daunting prospect of spoiled food and medication, sticky nights and the other familiar risks and indignities of being plunged into darkness. They are somewhat better equipped this time because those who could afford generators bought them after the Hurricane Maria fiasco. But that came with its own dangers: Officials on Monday said a man died while trying to operate a generator. His wife suffered severe burns, but survived.In the Dominican Republic, the storm killed at least one person, a 68-year-old man who was hit by a falling tree in the northern province of María Trinidad Sánchez, according to local media.As Hurricane Fiona moved westward, it battered the eastern provinces of the Dominican Republic, home to one of the largest tourism industries in the Caribbean. Heavy rain and 90-mile-per-hour winds set off mudslides that shuttered resorts and damaged highways, officials said.The storm is expected to pass near the islands of Turks and Caicos on Tuesday before strengthening at sea into a major hurricane — a Category 3 or higher — by Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. It is not forecast to approach the East Coast of the United States.In Puerto Rico, overflowing waterways and the loss of power caused pumps to fail, leaving 70 percent of households and businesses that rely on the public water and sewer system without potable water.Mr. Pierluisi said he had been coordinating with the White House to receive assistance. President Biden issued an emergency declaration on Sunday, unlocking federal funding and FEMA support. Mr. Biden called Mr. Pierluisi from Air Force One as the president flew back from the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in London, according to the White House.States also lined up to send mutual aid. New York said more than 100 Spanish-speaking members of the State Police would help clear streets, direct traffic and respond to other needs in Puerto Rico.Most customers who had electricity on Monday, including a couple of hospitals, were in the San Juan metropolitan area, which was spared the worst of Hurricane Fiona’s rains.The damage from Fiona’s floodwaters is expected to be vast — in the “billions,” Mr. Pierluisi estimated — a sobering reminder that a storm’s categorization under the Saffir-Simpson scale considers its maximum wind speeds, but not its rainfall or storm surge potential.In the town of Cayey, residents had to clear out the mud after the La Plata River surged and almost completely submerged a two-story house. A temporary bridge erected over the Guaonica River in Utuado buckled, its demise captured on dramatic video as rushing waters and debris washed it away. The bridge was put up after Hurricane Maria to connect devastated neighborhoods in the area, and a new, permanent bridge was scheduled to go up in 2024.In Santa Isabel, on the southern coast of the island, Itzamary Alvarado said she had more water in her house than during Hurricane Maria. Government officials, she said, should have given the public more warning about Hurricane Fiona, which had initially approached the island as a tropical storm.“I think the government minimized what was going to happen,” Ms. Alvarado said. “I found out it was a hurricane at 11 a.m. on Sunday, so I left everything and ran to the supermarket. I had not prepared for a hurricane.”For her and many others, the storm was a test of whether the government response to disasters would be better after Maria.“We have been struggling for five years and see the same conditions from the government in the management of emergency situations,” Ms. Alvarado said. “It’s frustrating.”But she suddenly had a sign that things were changing for the better: Trucks from Puerto Rico’s power company, LUMA, appeared on her street.“A LUMA brigade just drove by my house,” she said. “I’ve never seen that before.”Comparisons to Hurricane Maria were inevitable, from both residents and officials.The island’s hospitals were running on backup generators, in stark contrast to 2017, when many lost power, damaging medical equipment and leaving hundreds of sick patients dangerously at risk. About 75 percent of cellphone towers were still functioning after the storm passed, compared with the near-total signal wipeout five years ago.Mr. Pierluisi stressed that officials were still in the rescue-and-response phase of the emergency and had not begun to assess the scale of the damage, or determine the island’s path to recovery. Still, he said, the local government’s response had so far been “exemplary” compared with what happened after Maria.“Maria served as a lesson, an exercise for our emergency response teams at all levels,” Mr. Pierluisi, a member of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party who took office in 2021, said in a news conference. “In terms of the coordination we’ve seen, there’s a big difference.”Hurricane Maria, which struck within weeks of Hurricane Irma in 2017, laid bare the tenuous state of the island’s aging, poorly maintained infrastructure. Its powerful winds, with gusts exceeding 100 m.p.h., destroyed thousands of homes and wiped out the island’s agriculture and access to communications. Recovery was painfully sluggish, and the lack of potable water, fuel and food supplies in the wake of the storm prompted an exodus of tens of thousands of residents to the United States mainland.Public fury bubbled up at the government’s response to the storm. In 2019, a grass-roots movement channeling the anger formed, fueling a popular uprising in 2019 that lasted 15 days and caused former Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló to step down.Puerto Ricans remain skeptical of their leaders’ abilities to respond to disasters. In Salinas on Monday, Ana Medina Cardona, 74, said government reconstruction contractors had repaired a section of her tin roof that was torn apart by Hurricane Maria.On Sunday, rain started pouring through that repaired roof while she was home with her dog, Famy.“It seems they didn’t do a great job, because water was coming down the walls,” Ms. Medina Cardona said. “This time around, it was even worse than in Maria.”She waited in a shelter to hear if the water had receded enough for her to return home. But she was unconvinced it was her best option.“If we can go back,” she said, “that also means going back there to a house without power.”Reporting was contributed by Grace Ashford, Holga Enecia Pérez, Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Christine Hauser, Charo Henríquez, Anatoly Kurmanaev, Edgar Sandoval and Daniel Victor.</body>

	<title>Storms Slow California’s Mosquito Fire, but Bring Flash Flood Risk</title>
	<author>Kellen Browning</author>
	<body>We’ll start with the good news: Rainfall has brought relief to firefighters battling the Mosquito fire, California’s biggest blaze of the year. Showers that began on Sunday have allowed firefighters to roughly double the containment of the 76,000-acre fire, which erupted west of Lake Tahoe during a record-breaking heat wave.Now for the bad news: The storms have raised the risk of flash floods in the sheer, muddy hills damaged by fire. Weather officials have warned that people who live near the Mosquito burn scar should watch for flooding through the end of the day.“You have some areas where the vegetation is completely burned away off the side of a hill,” Scott McLean, a Cal Fire spokesman, said. “You get this moisture coming down, it’s going to loosen up that soil, because there’s nothing to hold the soil in place.”This one-two punch from Mother Nature has become a familiar story in California. This month, a tropical storm hit Riverside County in the midst of the enormous Fairview fire (now almost entirely contained), bringing the possibility of mudslides. In 2018, at least 21 people were killed by sudden flooding and mudslides following the Thomas fire in Santa Barbara County. In 2019, heavy rain in Marin County led to mudslides in communities that had recently been scorched by wildfires.Still, the rainfall around the Mosquito fire is largely welcome, McLean said. Firefighters had been struggling to control the blaze over the past two weeks, and its unpredictable behavior was an illustration of the increased danger and volatility of wildfires during a time of severe heat and drought.On the second day of the Mosquito fire, bone-dry vegetation and treacherous terrain threatened to triple the size of the blaze in a single afternoon, despite an all-out effort to contain it. Then, last week, just as officials started to feel as if they were gaining the upper hand, a spot fire sparked at the bottom of a steep canyon and raced upward into the community of Foresthill, destroying buildings before firefighters could beat it back.The incidents demonstrated a new, uncomfortable reality in today’s era of parched, sweltering California summers: Even a perfect firefighting response can fall short, and firefighters are now sometimes at the mercy of the weather.They have had to adjust their tactics as a result. With the Mosquito fire, they have shifted at times from directly attacking the fire to mitigating its spread by burning or destroying the vegetation it uses for fuel, then tackling it when conditions are better.“When I started fighting fires, the way you did it was you threw everything you had at it,” said Rob Scott, a fire behavior analyst with the U.S. Forest Service. “Now, there’s just so much fire and it’s so intense that you need to adopt strategies that are a little different.”As of Tuesday morning, with the help of rain showers, the Mosquito fire was 39 percent contained, a figure that is expected to increase over the next few days.But the fire won’t be extinguished by Thursday, when temperatures in the region are expected to start warming again and will continue to do so through next week, McLean said. That means the land and vegetation will begin to dry out again, and within the fire’s perimeter, new hot spots could emerge.For more:The Mosquito fire tests University of California research techniques.Track wildfires in the West.Heat, water, fire: How climate change is transforming the Pacific Crest Trail.A key to controlling carbon emissions: More buildings in a city’s unused spaces.Cal State raise: Lawmakers passed a last-minute bill requiring Cal State to give non-faculty staff raises, costing almost $900 million over 10 years, which the system says it cannot afford, CalMatters reports.House races: The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v.

	<title>Es Devlin’s Next Stage</title>
	<author>Andrew Dickson</author>
	<body>LONDON — Es Devlin was sitting in her garden communing with nature. Or rather, she was waving her phone, trying to get a bird song identification app to pick up chirrups from the surrounding trees. “Definitely two birds talking to each other, isn’t it?” she said. “I always want to know what they are. I’ve got a bit obsessed.”Obsessed is one way of putting it. For the past few years, Devlin, one of the world’s most in-demand stage designers, has been moonlighting as a conservationist. Most recently, she has been getting to know the birds, bats, moths and fungi that are most at risk in London from threats including the climate crisis and habitat loss.Those creatures will be celebrated in “Come Home Again,” a “choral sculpture” created by Devlin and her studio that will be unveiled on Wednesday. Installed outside Tate Modern until Oct. 1, it will be filled with the sounds of birds, bats and insects and decorated with Devlin’s black-and-white drawings of 243 species on an endangered list prepared by the London authorities. Devlin had been sketching for almost four months, she said, sometimes for 18 hours a day.Her work ethic is relentless. She reckoned that, since beginning as a theater designer in the mid-1990s, she had worked on “about 380” projects — but also that she’d done “a few since I last counted.” And while plenty of visual artists have made cameo appearances as stage designers (Chagall, Dalí, Picasso, Indiana, Hockney), Devlin is rare in having traveled in the opposite direction. These days, you’re as likely to encounter her work in art galleries, stadium gigs, fashion shows or architecture expos as in theaters or opera houses.Early on, she developed a reputation for crafting stage visuals that became the talking point of a show. In 1996, for her first professional job at a regional English theater — Christopher Marlowe’s murderous “Edward II” — she studied plumbing to create a bathhouse-style set whose showers ran with blood. Two years later, at the National Theater, a ghostly set for Harold Pinter’s “Betrayal” impressed the famously cantankerous playwright. According to newspaper reports, he asked during an opening night meet-and-greet, “Have you met Es Devlin? She wrote the play.”One reason Devlin drew so much attention was that she rejected the English theater orthodoxy that designs should be attractive décor that would blend into the background. “I wasn’t ever afraid for the objects I made to be the protagonists,” she said. “Not everyone thought like that.”When one of Kanye West’s assistants called, in 2005, and asked Devlin to help save his ailing “Touch the Sky” arena tour, she was on a plane to New York 24 hours later, with books about James Turrell and Wagner to inspire the rapper, with whom she collaborated on new designs. Her most recent large-scale triumph, a set for the Super Bowl halftime show, last February, involved a larger-than-life-size model of part of Dr. Dre’s hometown, Compton, Calif.“Whatever she’s working in, Es does it with absolute commitment,” said Alex Poots, the artistic director of The Shed, in a phone interview. He first spotted Devlin’s work at a fringe London theater in the early 2000s and convinced her to design a gig for the British art punk band Wire, her first foray into music. “There are so many different sides to what she can do. That was obvious even then.”The work at Tate Modern is a case in point. Like many of Devlin’s projects, “Come Home Again” has many layers and teems with references: From outside, it resembles the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral, which it faces across the River Thames. Inside, the audience will be invited to sit down and enjoy performances by London-based choirs. When they aren’t performing, the space will be filled with recorded bird song and animal noises.Devlin explained that visitors would also be able to scan QR codes inside the installation that will bring up information about the endangered species. “If we give something a name, we give it a place in our imagination,” she said. “The piece is all about imagination.”When it was suggested that this sounded complicated, Devlin grinned. “I really like complexity,” she said.Though more and more of her work is taken up by self-initiated projects, rather than commissions, Devlin said she still sees herself as a collaborative artist; well-funded gigs in fashion and music help her maintain a small studio of architects and designers. “I will often have an idea, but I really lean on my studio to help me evolve it,” she said, adding that concurrent projects often fed into each other, even if they’re wildly different.A “rain box” — a glass enclosure onto which images of rain were projected — cropped up in both a London production of Brian Friel’s play “Faith Healer,” in 2016, and a stadium tour by Adele that same year. Boxes, indeed, have become something of a Devlin signature: A spinning cube stood in for a Manhattan gallery and a Beijing police interrogation room in her design for Lucy Kirkwood’s 2013 play “Chimerica,” and the action of Stefano Massini’s “The Lehman Trilogy,” which came to Broadway earlier this year, took place inside an airless, rotating glass tank.The curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, who has collaborated with Devlin several times, said that her determination to work in several fields had opened a path for younger artists. “You see that happening more and more,” he said. “People are working in poetry, but also visual art. They’re making music as well as tech. The thing that’s impressive about Es is that she’s been doing it a long time, and that her work is taken seriously in all these different places.”Devlin had broken ground, Poots agreed. “I’m not sure she’d have been able to have this kind of career 10 years ago,” he said. “It’s like the world is finally ready for her.”The fall is turning into something of a Devlin retrospective in London. Last week, revivals of two operas she designed for the Royal Opera House, “Salome” and “Don Giovanni,” returned to the company’s stage. On Wednesday, a new production of Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” directed by another longtime collaborator, Lyndsey Turner, opens at the National Theater.Alongside the drama and opera work that still occupies much of her time, she is planning an art show in New York with Pace gallery, exhibiting her drawings. Oh, and there is a book for Thames and Hudson in the works — highlights from her vast back catalog. It was meant to come out a few years ago, but she hasn’t had time. “I should really finish it,” she said, grimacing.How does she describe herself these days? Designer? Artist? Something else? She laughed, and said she drew inspiration from Christopher Wren, the polymathic astronomer-turned-architect who designed St. Paul’s Cathedral: “Multi-hyphenate is fine.”</body>

	<title>Inflation Remains Voters’ Top Concern. Can Republicans Keep Their Focus?</title>
	<author>Jonathan Weisman</author>
	<body>Zach Nunn, an Iowa Republican challenging one of the House’s most vulnerable Democrats, had been talking for months about rising prices when a Texas congressman two weeks ago invited him to visit the Mexican border — to see the fentanyl confiscated, hear tales of dying migrants and witness overwhelmed border agents.Mr. Nunn took it all in, he said. Then, he went back to a district that stretches from Des Moines to the Missouri line to talk about inflation some more.“You know, from knocking on 10,000 doors, what people are interested in,” Mr. Nunn said. It would not matter, he said, if he were speaking in Clarinda, Iowa — a city of 5,300 — or West Des Moines, a city of 70,000. “People are all talking about what is going on with the economy,” he said.In the six-month primary season that came to a close on Tuesday, issues like abortion, crime, immigration, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, and Donald J. Trump have risen and fallen, but nothing has dislodged inflation and the economy from the top of voters’ minds. On Wednesday, polls out of Wisconsin and Georgia again found inflation to be the issue of greatest concern.A New York Times/Siena poll released on Friday had bright spots for Democrats, but 49 percent of respondents said that “economic issues such as jobs, taxes or the cost of living” were likely to determine their votes in November, compared with 31 percent who saw “societal issues such as abortion, guns or democracy” as decisive. And 52 percent of registered voters said they agreed with Republicans on the economy, versus 38 percent who said they agreed with Democrats.And Republican candidates aren’t letting go.“Inflation is now high enough to rob every working American of a month’s pay over the course of a year,” said Tom Barrett, a Michigan state senator challenging Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, in a Republican-leaning district around Lansing.Representative Nancy Mace, Republican of South Carolina, released her first advertisement of the general election on Thursday — and it focused solely on inflation.“I’m Nancy Mace, and I have had it with crazy inflation,” she says to the camera as she counts up the cost of cooking an eggs-and-bacon breakfast. (Milk, $4 a gallon, a dozen eggs, nearly $4, and bacon, $8 a pack.)For all the losers in an inflationary economy, there are also winners: people with large mortgages or student loan burdens that shrink away in real terms as incomes rise with inflation but debts do not; workers whose wages suddenly rise, sometimes enough to keep pace with prices; frugal seniors who enjoy Social Security cost-of-living increases tied to the inflation rate and higher interest rates on their savings accounts.Even so, inflation has had outsize potency as a political issue for at least a century — and since hyperinflation after World War I helped usher in authoritarianism across Europe, few issues have been quite so politically destabilizing.In the mid-1990s, Robert J. Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale who was puzzled by the power of inflation as a disruptive force, surveyed people in the United States, Germany and Brazil to determine why inflation had always produced so much anger, wounded national pride and a feeling that an unwritten social contract between citizens and their government had been broken.Facing deep feelings of insecurity, anxiety and unfairness, “not a single respondent volunteered anywhere on the questionnaire that he or she benefited from inflation,” he marveled.For Republicans seeking control of Congress, that history still could prove determinative, even as Democrats try to center their campaigns on abortion rights and democratic pluralism and Republican strategists test other themes, like crime, the border and Democratic “radicalism.”Representative Kim Schrier, a Democrat in the suburbs of Seattle who is locked in a tossup contest for re-election, has gone after her Republican opponent, Matt Larkin, on abortion, using her background as a physician to press a persona of earnest trustworthiness. Democratic campaign officials in Washington, D.C., have accused Mr. Larkin of questioning the election results of 2020 and refusing to acknowledge President Biden as legitimately elected.Mr. Larkin’s response? The price of eggs, “up 52 percent in Washington State,” he said Thursday, and milk, “way, way up in the Eighth District.”How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.Voters, he said in an interview, “are very, very concerned.”And, in a country where one party controls the House, the Senate and the White House — and in a state where Democrats control pretty much everything — “there’s also a sense that the Democrats in general are doing this,” Mr. Larkin added.That, too, is consistent with economic history: Citizens of countries suffering from inflation have routinely sought to assign blame — to the government, to greedy companies or to politicians. Inflationary periods often yield labor strife, as workers and unions press for wage increases to keep up with rising prices, point fingers at “price-gouging” companies and, more than anything, rage at those in power.Richard M. Nixon’s 1968 victory over Hubert Humphrey is popularly attributed to the Vietnam War and domestic unrest, but inflation was a “top three” issue, even though price increases were a relatively mild 4.27 percent, said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist with deep connections to the national Democratic Party.Gerald R. Ford’s defeat in 1976 is often ascribed to the hangover from Watergate, but his WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons became an object of ridicule in a year in which inflation was still pushing 6 percent. Four years later, Jimmy Carter’s dreams of a second term were vaporized by 13.5 percent inflation.And in 1982, as the Federal Reserve was engineering a recession to finally get control of price gains and Ronald Reagan was absorbing the blame, Democrats beat Republicans by nearly 12 percentage points in the midterm elections — and padded their House majority by 27 seats.“From bitter historical experience, we know how quickly inflation destroys confidence in the reliability of political institutions and ends up endangering democracy,” Helmut Kohl, the chancellor of Germany, said in 1995, harking back to the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic.In 2022, Republicans like State Senator Jen Kiggans, who is challenging Representative Elaine Luria in southeast Virginia, are using inflation not only to go after the party in power, but also to deflect Democratic charges of “radicalism” by portraying themselves as ordinary family folks, in touch with consumer reality.For voters, however, the signals from the actual economy are mixed. The official inflation report last Tuesday showed that prices in August rose 8.3 percent from a year earlier, only slightly better than July’s 8.5 percent. But because of rapidly falling gasoline prices, overall consumer costs from the month before rose a barely noticeable 0.1 percent. Prices at the pump, the most visible inflationary signal to consumers, are expected to continue their fall in the weeks leading up to the election. That could offer at least psychological relief to consumers — and Democrats — as other cost-of-living indicators like food and rent send stock traders and the Federal Reserve running for shelter.“If you’re going to have 8 percent inflation over the year before up to the election, you’d like to have the last three months at zero, so the sequencing is about as good as it could be” for Democrats, Mr. Furman said.Mr. Barrett conceded that these fresh signals could blunt the political impact. “To some degree, they boiled the frog, then turned the temperature down a notch on the stove,” he said, “but it’s still raging hot.”And his Democratic opponent, Ms, Slotkin, has taken pains to address the issue, too, ticking off legislation and administrative actions that she said she supported to address inflation. They include suspending the federal gas tax, releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, pressing companies on “price gouging” and granting Medicare the authority to negotiate drug prices.“Certainly if there was a silver bullet to fix it, it would have been fired,” she said, adding, “leaders need to do all they can — not just use it as a political issue.”Republicans say that, as children go back to school, higher prices on clothes, food and school supplies will come more into focus, and cold weather will bring the sticker shock of soaring heating bills. The disorienting power of price increases is all the more potent, experts say, because Americans have not weathered them in four decades.Democrats hope to turn voters’ minds elsewhere. On the lengthy “issues” web page of Mr. Nunn’s opponent, Representative Cindy Axne, the word inflation does not appear, though she does mention inflation in one campaign ad as being among a litany of travails hitting Iowans recently. In another ad, Ms. Axne acknowledges that “rising costs are hurting Iowa families everywhere.”On Friday, Emilia Sykes, the Democratic candidate for an open House seat in northeast Ohio, released a new ad saying she has “a plan to lower costs,” though she avoided the word inflation.Elsewhere, Democrats are focusing almost exclusively on abortion, democracy and the overall theme that Republicans who have undermined the integrity of elections and democratic institutions cannot be trusted with power.In that sense, the parties are entering the final sprint to Nov. 8 largely talking past each other.But the unique ability of inflation to anger voters and undermine authorities in power should not be underestimated, economists say. Wage increases, though stronger than they have been in years, have not kept pace with inflation this year, but in 2021, when voters’ anger showed up most clearly in polling, average family incomes “far exceeded” price gains, thanks in large part to temporary tax cuts and income supplements approved in successive pandemic-relief measures, said Austan Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist.“Average actual real incomes went up, not down,” he said, “so it’s still a puzzle.”For Republicans, there is no mystery, only the challenge of staying on the issue as Democrats try to direct voters’ attention anywhere else.“This stuff is real,” Mr. Barrett said on Thursday. “The Democrats are whistling past the graveyard.”</body>

	<title>‘House of the Dragon’ Stars Say Goodbye to HBO’s Biggest Hit</title>
	<author>Sean T. Collins</author>
	<body>They anchored the earliest episodes of one of the biggest shows on television, but Milly Alcock and Emily Carey have no idea what they’re doing next — including whether or not they’ll ever return to the “Game of Thrones” prequel, “House of the Dragon,” in flashbacks or otherwise.“I don’t even know what I’m doing tomorrow,” Alcock said. “So no idea.”“I don’t even know what I’m having for dinner!” Carey added.The performers are at loose ends after originating two of the primary characters in “Dragon”: Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Alcock), heir to the Iron Throne of Westeros, and Queen Alicent Hightower (Carey), who hopes her offspring will one day usurp the claim of her one-time best friend. The fifth episode, which aired Sunday, was the end of their tenure; a narrative time jump will see Emma D’Arcy take over as Rhaenyra and Olivia Cooke as Alicent. For Alcock and Carey, it’s a time of uncertainty.“Me and Emily had this conversation today,” Alcock, 22, said during a conference call from London last week. “We were like, ‘I don’t know what the [expletive] I’m doing any of the time now.’ I’ve been pacing.”“Milly paces, and I sit and do Lego, and that’s the vibe,” Carey, 19, added.“That’s the vibe,” Alcock echoed.Like the characters they portray, these two actors have been asked to shoulder an enormous burden at a young age. They’ve been crucial components in HBO’s big-budget gamble that fans of “Game of Thrones,” the network’s fantasy phenomenon, would flock to a prequel set nearly 175 years before Daenerys Targaryen was even a twinkle in the Mad King’s eye. But that gamble has paid dividends, and Alcock’s and Carey’s skills in depicting their characters’ complex relationship has been a key to the show’s success.Where do things go from here? Alcock and Carey are wondering, too.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.The two of you anchored the first five episodes of the spinoff of the biggest show in HBO history, which has become a huge hit in its own right. How have your lives changed?MILLY ALCOCK There’s been a great sense of terror, of fear, of excitement. But there’s also been this utterly welcoming reassurance that me and Em have the privilege of being able to do this for the rest of our lives. That’s something that any actor dreams of: having a sense that it’s not all going to fall apart underneath you.EMILY CAREY It’s strange, being visible. For me, that’s the main thing that’s changed: going from being able to blend in, to being seen.On a fundamental level, this story hinges on Rhaenyra and Alicent. How was their relationship reflected in the relationship between the two of you as actors?CAREY We’re very lucky in that we get along in real life, so the chemistry came very organically. We’re quite like our characters.ALCOCK They’re very similar.CAREY I’m very type-A, very anxious and very dutiful. I follow the rules. Mil’s a lot more like Rhaenyra in that sense. [Both laugh.] But I see Milly as a big sister, which is different than the characters are onscreen. Still, that closeness you see between Rhaenyra and Alicent is definitely a reflection of ours in real life.ALCOCK Me and Em went through a very similar experience that our characters went through: We were both thrown into this massive role, and when it actually happened, you don’t know how to react. We’re two very young women who haven’t done massive projects before, in an environment full of men, having to live up to this opportunity. We were forced to hang on to each other for dear life.CAREY And we haven’t let go yet.ALCOCK God, no. It’s not going to happen.It’s also a story about families.ALCOCK It’s ultimately about dysfunctional fathers, at the heart of it, which I can relate to.CAREY The same. Been there.ALCOCK Done that.One of the show’s central themes, about women’s autonomy over their own bodies and futures, has become even more salient since production began, with the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.CAREY I think that’s what makes the show so watchable, relatable to a modern-day audience. It’s so much more than fantasy and dragons. There’s grounded, truthful topics and story lines that reflect the world we live in.ALCOCK It explores the trauma that these two women would have faced within that world — not only the patriarchy, but the internalized misogyny. These two women are forced to battle with one another because of the choices made by men.The irony of social media being like, “I don’t want to say goodbye to Milly for Emma,” or comparing Em to Liv! That is what the whole show is about, and people are still doing it. So it’s clever.How much have you worked with Emma and Olivia on —ALCOCK We didn’t, at all. Nothing. Zero.Interesting!ALCOCK I know. [Laughs.]So you must be as curious as anybody to see how the characters will continue without you.CAREY Yeah, I’m so intrigued. We didn’t even read the scripts that we weren’t in, so we know very little about what happens after we leave.ALCOCK We weren’t given [the scripts]. I’ve asked for them so much, and they were like, “No, you cannot.” I’m going to be watching on the edge of my seat, because I want to know what’s going to happen.What does it feel like to hand the reins of Rhaenyra and Alicent over to new actors?ALCOCK I’m so excited to see what Emma did with Rhaenyra. There’s no way I could have played her in the later stages of her life because I don’t have the same lived experience that Emma has. So I’m so keen.CAREY I love the way you worded that, Mil. That’s so true. When people say, “Do you wish you could do the rest of it?,” I’m always like, “I don’t know.” I don’t think I have the capacity.But I will be honest: It’s strange handing off a character that is so personal. As actors, we put so much of ourselves into the people we play. So it’s strange having to leave someone’s story halfway through.At the same time, it doesn’t feel unfinished because it’s going into obviously amazing hands with Olivia. It’s going to be really cool — and weird — to watch the show as a viewer and not be critiquing our own performances, and just take it in and appreciate the show for what it is.Do you feel there was a sublimated romantic or sexual tension between Rhaenyra and Alicent?CAREY As a queer person myself, I read an undertone in the script that I knew could be played. That being said, I don’t think Ryan Condal [a creator and showrunner] sat there writing a Sapphic drama. If you want to see it, you can. If you want to pretend it’s not there, you can also do that.The thing is, these girls don’t know what “platonic” or “romantic” means, whether that be the words or the feelings themselves. There’s just a closeness between two young women that cannot be verbalized, especially in the world they live in. I don’t think they fully understand the feelings; it’s just all-consuming love.There’s an underlying jealousy that I read into it, especially coming off the back of Episode 4. It was this scene where we were on a bench, and it’s the first time we’ve seen these two women reconnect after losing this closeness they had. I remember in rehearsal at the end of the scene, we were like, “Did you feel like we were about to kiss?”ALCOCK And I was like, “Yeah!”CAREY Yeah, dude, it felt like we were going to kiss. That was really strange.We didn’t do anything to make them gay, or to force “the gay” upon anyone. It felt so natural. As I said, it’s easy to ignore if you really don’t want to look at it. But if you’re rooting for them and you want to make the story more heartbreaking, then choose to see it.</body>

	<title>Zelensky Meets With BlackRock Chief to Discuss Reconstruction Fund</title>
	<author>Jason Karaian</author>
	<body>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with Laurence D. Fink, the head of BlackRock, the world’s largest manager of assets, to discuss how to attract investment in the country’s war-ravaged economy.In a videoconference, the two discussed how BlackRock, which oversees $8.5 trillion invested all over the world, could provide “pro bono advice to the Ukrainian government on setting up a reconstruction fund in support of the recovery of the Ukrainian economy,” according to a statement released on Monday by Mr. Zelensky’s office. (The call was held Thursday.) The fund would be arranged for “both public and private investors to participate in reconstructing and rejuvenating the market economy in Ukraine,” the statement said.“We’ve shown that we know how to win on the battlefield,” Mr. Zelensky said in the statement. “Another important task for us is to achieve victories in the economy as well, and to be an attractive country for investors.”The advice would be provided by BlackRock’s Financial Market Advisory team, which works with financial institutions, regulators and governments, and is separate from the company’s investment management business.Estimates of the cost to rebuild the infrastructure hit hardest by the war with Russia, and revive the country’s shattered economy, vary widely. The Ukrainian government has put the bill at $750 billion, while others have estimated $100 billion, still a significant sum. The International Monetary Fund has said Ukraine needs $5 billion per month to pay government salaries and pensions, and to cover other expenses. The fund has already provided over $1 billion to help Ukraine keep up on government debt payments.Much of the money to rebuild Ukraine’s economy would probably come from donor countries, in the form of grants or long-term loans, given the precarious state of the Ukrainian government’s finances. The United States, the European Union and others have provided billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine, in addition to pledging extensive economic aid.Attracting private investors in Ukraine is challenging while the war still rages. Ukraine’s government has encouraged entrepreneurs with grants, zero-interest loans and other financial support, with companies large and small restructuring and relocating, altering the country’s economic geography. An end to the fighting, along with extensive insurance and other arrangements to attract international private investment in Ukraine’s fragile economy, would be necessary before Ukraine could “restore a normal investment climate,” as Mr. Zelensky described his goals in the statement.Many of Ukraine’s public and private lenders, including BlackRock, have agreed to a freeze on payments on tens of billions of dollars in debt.Ukraine’s postwar investment push also has to overcome perceptions of systemic corruption. Transparency International, an anticorruption watchdog, ranked Ukraine 122nd out of 180 countries on its corruption index in 2021.</body>

	<title>‘Four Saints in Three Acts’ Review: An Opera Becomes a One-Man Show</title>
	<author>Laura Collins-Hughes</author>
	<body>One minute the actor David Greenspan is giving the preshow speech, as welcoming and easy as can be, explaining that the theater has held the curtain a few minutes because of trouble with the subway, and asking us, the audience, to turn off our phones.An instant later, with no warning whatsoever, not even a change of light, he has slipped into the play and pulled us with him. It seems somehow like he’s gentled us into it with benevolent trickery — as if he’d said, “Look! Over there,” and while we were distracted ripped a Band-Aid off our skin.Because, truth be told, even those who adored the experimental virtuosity of his earlier solo projects “The Patsy” and “Strange Interlude” might approach his latest project with some trepidation: a staging of Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson’s large-cast, 1934 opera “Four Saints in Three Acts” as a one-man play, divested of its music.The script is simply Stein’s libretto, unaltered — a chaotically opaque, willfully bizarre text that occasionally turns inquiring and poetic but is most often principally concerned with the sound of language and the human voice. It doesn’t much go in for fripperies like character and narrative and sense.Actual number of saints in the play? Dozens, though you will swiftly catch on that Saint Therese is Stein’s unrivaled favorite. Number of acts? Four. This show wants to mess with you, and it will — especially since Thomson decided, before the opera’s premiere in 1934, that Stein’s stage directions should be verbalized by the performers, just part of the show.The Lucille Lortel Theater, which is presenting “Four Saints” at the Doxsee in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, seems to acknowledge the audience’s potential unease, emblazoning the cover of the program with a quote from Stein about the play: “If you enjoy it you understand it.”I’m not so sure that’s true of her text, but it certainly is of Greenspan’s mesmerizing interpretation, which rides the circles and switchbacks of Stein’s language like a current. His tone and volume ever-shifting, his sense of humor well in evidence, he makes flickering sense of her verbiage, even as the fragments together form a cyclone of non sequiturs.Anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the lives of saints should look elsewhere; nothing in this play is that conventional. Still, the performance is approachably easy to enjoy, with one strict caveat. If you are the caregiver of a small child who is going through a repetitive phase, “Four Saints” is likely to drive you straight up the wall. Repetition, loads of it, is Stein’s métier.“Ordinary pigeons and trees,” Greenspan says, somewhere in the thickets of Act 3. “This is a setting which is as soon which is as soon which is as soon ordinary setting which is as soon which is as soon and noon. Ordinary pigeons and trees.”Well, of course.Watching Greenspan perform this play, with his silent-screen expressiveness and full-body eloquence, is like watching a manic movie montage spliced together from bits of film, each brief segment making a kind of sense in its moment, independent of the whole. Or like watching channels flipped fast fast fast by someone with zero attention span. And yet Greenspan doesn’t squander a second.Stein, for all her formidable reputation, liked a good time — and loved experimental derring-do. This pleasurable production, directed by Ken Rus Schmoll and designed by Yuki Nakase Link, makes me wish Stein could see it, maybe trade letters about it with her good friend and playwright pen pal Thornton Wilder, whom she first met when “Four Saints” was new.“Stein often referred to ‘Four Saints’ as a play,” Greenspan writes in a program note. “I have taken her at her word.”Ninety-five years after she wrote it, in 1927, her text is as inscrutable as ever. Yet Greenspan, an intrepid investigator, has thrown himself into its mysteries and come away relishing them. Through the generous affection of his meticulous performance, so do we.Four Saints in Three ActsThrough Oct. 9 at the Doxsee at Target Margin Theater, Brooklyn; lortel.org.

	<title>Crowds gather in Windsor as they await the arrival of the queen’s coffin from London.</title>
	<author>Stephen Castle</author>
	<body>WINDSOR, England — Thousands of people, some carrying British flags, gathered on Monday along the approach to Windsor Castle that Queen Elizabeth II’s coffin will take on its final journey.With a wait of several hours ahead of them on the approach, known as the Long Walk, some had brought food and drink. They also watched the funeral service that was taking place in London on large screens that had been provided for those waiting for the procession to arrive in Windsor, about 25 miles west of the capital.Karl Dixon, from the town of Glossop, England, said he had traveled to Windsor on Friday and had slept in a motor home since then.This was the first royal event he had attended, he said. “I just felt this is the final resting place. It was also her home, and her late husband is buried here as well as a lot of her ancestors,” said Mr. Dixon, a landscape gardener whose dog, a basset hound, sported a British flag on his leash.“She’s done 70 years of service — three or four days for her is the least I can do as a mark of respect,” he said of the queen.Ben Pearson, from nearby Maidenhead, said the queen had been a symbol of continuity for his entire life. “It seems right to come and pay our respects and watch her journey home,” said Mr. Pearson, who works in the financial sector and who arrived around 9 a.m. Monday, well ahead of the afternoon events in Windsor.Ailsa Wood, a farm owner from Hedgerley, also near Windsor, who had arrived before 6 a.m., said of the queen: “She was an amazing woman. She devoted her life to the country.”Among those who came from abroad was Al Gonzales, a former New York City police officer and musician who said that he had once been invited to play the pipes for the queen privately at Balmoral, her Scottish country estate.“I am affected at a personal level, but I am impressed that there is such an outpouring among the British people,” said Mr. Gonzales, who lives in New York. “Being here is particularly striking to see the genuine warmth and respect that the British people are showing: They are handling it in their uniquely British way.”</body>

	<body>As New York struggles to find housing for a wave of migrants, Mayor Eric Adams is seriously considering housing them on cruise ships — a proposal that homeless advocates have called insulting and alienating.Mr. Adams defended the idea on Monday and said the city was looking for “creative ways” to address a “humanitarian crisis.” He said the city would make an announcement once the plans were finalized.“We’re not going to leave any stone unturned,” he told reporters on Monday. The Adams administration has been working behind the scenes on the plan to use cruise ships — an idea that former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg considered in 2002 when he struggled to respond to a homelessness crisis, and that advocates for the homeless opposed at the time.The mayor’s chief of staff, Frank Carone, has spoken with leaders of Norwegian Cruise Line, a major cruise ship company, to discuss the possibility of housing asylum seekers on one of its ships, according to someone familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. Mr. Carone stayed on one of the company’s cruise ships in Normandy, France, last month, as part of the administration’s research, the person said. Mr. Adams grew irritated on Monday over questions about Mr. Carone’s travels and refused to answer questions about them at a news conference. A spokesman for the mayor, Maxwell Young, later added that no taxpayer money was used for the trip.Mr. Adams, a Democrat, met with Norwegian Cruise Line’s chief executive, Frank Del Rio, on June 12 on East 57th Street in Manhattan, according to the mayor’s detailed schedules, which were recently released through a Freedom of Information request by The New York Times.At the time, the city had just begun to see an uptick in migrants. The city has said that more than 11,000 people have arrived from the border since May, many sent on buses by Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas. Although many have a place to go, the population of the city’s main shelter system has jumped by 22 percent since mid-May, to 56,000, an increase of 10,000 in four months. The shelter population grew by nearly 2,000 just in the past week.Thousands of migrants, most of them Venezuelans, have been coaxed onto buses and planes heading to Washington, New York, Chicago and even Martha’s Vineyard after making a perilous journey to the border. Mr. Adams has publicly quarreled with Mr. Abbott, criticizing his approach as inhumane and arguing that the governor’s failure to coordinate with cities was making it more difficult to address their needs.Mr. Adams announced on Monday that a young female migrant died by suicide in a shelter on Sunday. The mayor called her death a tragedy and said the city would continue to offer mental health services to migrants. He said the city could not provide further information about the woman or the details of her death.On Friday, Mr. Adams mentioned the idea of using cruise ships to house migrants for the first time in an interview with Marcia Kramer on WCBS-TV. “We’re examining everything, from the legality of using any type of cruise ship for temporary housing,” he said. “We’re looking at everything to see how do we deal with this.”Mr. Adams noted that the Bloomberg administration had considered the idea of putting homeless families on a cruise ship in 2002, when New York City’s  shelter system had a smaller population of 36,000 people. The Bloomberg administration abandoned the idea after receiving criticism.“If you think about a cruise ship, it’s exactly what you need,” Mr. Bloomberg said at the time. “Rooms with bathrooms that are safe, that we can afford, in a neighborhood we can use.”What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source.Deborah Diamant, the director of legal affairs for the Coalition for the Homeless, said that the cruise ship idea was insulting and raised concerns over providing people access to transportation, food and schools. She said it was part of a campaign by Mr. Adams, who has cleared encampments, to try to make the homeless crisis less visible.“He’s been pushing people to the margins, and he’s been pushing people out of sight,” she said. “We’re pushing them so far here on to cruise ships — off the land and onto the water.”Ms. Diamant said she was concerned about whether cruise ships would be accessible and safe, noting that they were known as places where the coronavirus had spread quickly.“It just seems absurd that the city would consider cruise ships once again as a solution to the homelessness crisis,” she said. “We know what the solution is — it’s permanent affordable housing.”Craig Hughes, a senior social worker with the Urban Justice Center, said the city should speed up the timeline for moving people out of shelters instead of placing homeless people in cruise ships. Noting that the average length of stay in shelters has increased significantly over recent years, he said, “Empty the shelters and you have more room to house people that need shelter that are coming in through the front doors.” Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Mr. Adams, said that the city had “no details to share at this time” regarding the use of cruise ships to house migrants.“We said earlier this week that we need to reassess the whole situation, and that is why we’re discussing different ideas to see if they work,” Mr. Levy said in a statement. “This idea is part of that reassessment.”Mr. Levy added that the mayor’s meeting with Mr. Del Rio in June “had nothing to do with asylum seekers.”Mr. Adams said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that he was not considering abandoning the city’s “right to shelter” law, which guarantees shelter for anyone who asks for it, but he said that New York must reassess how it carries out the law.“We don’t believe we should change the right-to-shelter law,” he said. “What needs to be looked at is the actual practices.”The mayor received criticism last week for raising doubts about the city’s commitment to the right-to-shelter law. The mayor said New York was facing a “breaking point” and criticized Mr. Abbott for failing to coordinate bus arrivals with the city.A representative for Norwegian Cruise Line did not immediately respond to a request for comment.City officials have opened 23 emergency shelters to handle the influx of migrants. But the city recently failed to offer beds to 60 migrants who arrived at the center on East 30th Street in Manhattan where homeless men are assessed when they first enter the shelter system — the first major such lapse in over a decade.The city has previously turned to its waterways to deal with overcrowding. In 1989, when a steep increase in drug arrests filled the Rikers Island jail complex, the city used a converted British troopship as a prison barge to house inmates and docked it in the Bay Ridge neighborhood in Brooklyn. Another floating jail barge, the Vernon C. Bain Center, is docked just north of Rikers Island. It opened in 1992 as a temporary solution and never closed. Stephen Eide, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute who has written a history of homelessness in America, said that on a recent visit to Rikers Island, he was told by a Department of Correction press officer that the Bain Center had fewer problems than many of the complex’s land-based buildings. He said that he thought this made the idea of a cruise ship shelter “somewhat promising,” though he added, “Needless to say when you’re talking about Rikers, you’re grading on a curve.”In 2002, Mr. Bloomberg was criticized for placing homeless families in a former jail. He refused to move them, even in the face of a political storm.That year, Mr. Bloomberg’s commissioner of homeless services, Linda I. Gibbs, toured luxury cruise liners off the Bahamas. She said at the time that the liners could be a good option for housing homeless people, but she was concerned about the cost of converting them to meet the needs of the homeless population.“We would have to remove bars and discos, which are inappropriate for a shelter,” she said.Grace Ashford contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>‘I Would Be Booing Myself,’ Broncos Coach Admits After Win</title>
	<author>Victor Mather</author>
	<body>After their beloved team lost in Week 1, Denver Broncos fans were fuming at their new coach, Nathaniel Hackett, who had made a baffling decision at the end of a Monday night loss in Seattle.So how were they feeling after a Week 2 win on Sunday over the Houston Texans? Well, many of them were still fuming.Hackett, hired by Denver in January after three years as Green Bay’s offensive coordinator, once again puzzled fans with play calling that cost the team a drive — though not the game.With four minutes remaining in the third quarter, the Broncos trailed the Texans by 9-6 and faced a third-and-1 at the Texans 35. What play might you call there? A quarterback sneak? A plunge with a running back who was averaging more than 5 yards a carry at the time? A quick outlet pass to try to catch the defense napping?Whatever your choice, Hackett’s decision — a slow-motion sweep featuring a handoff to the tight end — was probably not the best call.When that tight end, Andrew Beck, got the ball from Russell Wilson, he was already 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. Texans defenders were coming fast. Nearing the sideline, Beck moved a couple more yards backward, seemed to fake a pitch to a teammate, and was tackled for a 1-yard loss. He never came close to gaining the required yard.The team’s No. 1 back, Javonte Williams, was available. But the ball went to Beck, a tight end, who was — incredibly — making only his second career carry.That led to a Broncos 55-yard field goal attempt, which was good … except that it was kicked after the play clock had expired, largely because the Broncos took too much time deciding whether to send out the field goal team. Boos rained down from Denver fans. “I don’t blame them,” Hackett said after the game. “I would be booing myself.”The 5-yard penalty pushed Denver out of realistic field goal range — though with Hackett the concept of realistic range can vary — and the Broncos punted.The team also threw away its final two timeouts with nine and seven minutes left in the game. Since the Broncos had a clock problem in their opening-night loss, this week home fans decided their help was needed.In the fourth quarter many at Denver’s Empower Field began counting down the play clock as a friendly, if sarcastic, reminder to the coaching staff to get plays off on time.“I guess that was helpful if needed,” Wilson told reporters. “I guess they do that in basketball sometimes.”Despite holding on to their lead for a 16-9 win, there were other disquieting signs for Denver on Sunday. The team didn’t score a touchdown until the fourth quarter after scoring only one the previous week. Wilson was 14 for 31 for 219 yards, a touchdown and an interception, a comedown from a solid first week and a preseason filled with optimism since his off-season acquisition from Seattle. And the team committed a whopping 13 penalties after being called for 12 last week.“All I really care about is the cheers at the end,” Wilson said, “because we won.”It is Hackett’s issues with the clock, though, that were perhaps most concerning, since last week’s loss also featured some puzzling clock management. Trailing by a point with more than a minute left in the game and facing a fourth-and-5 near midfield, Hackett let 43 seconds burn off the clock before bringing Wilson and the offense off and sending out Brandon McManus to try a 64-yard field goal. The kick would have been tied for the second longest in N.F.L. history, but McManus missed it.“Looking back at it, we definitely should have gone for it,” Hackett said afterward.On Sunday, even as he reveled in his team’s first win, he acknowledged it had made too many mistakes, saying, “That’s on us.”“Too sloppy by the offense,” Hackett said. “There were too many things where we just made it hard on ourselves.”Hackett has only two games under his belt as a head coach. So one might think allowances would be made. But the booing by the home crowd and two weeks of negative headlines are proof that honeymoons do not last long in the N.F.L.The Broncos host the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. They are 2-point favorites. And if there were an over/under on Hackett blunders it would probably be about 1½.</body>

	<title>Norway’s $1.2 Trillion Investment Fund Sets 2050 Climate Target</title>
	<author>Peter Eavis</author>
	<body>The huge government fund that invests Norway’s oil revenue said on Tuesday that it was going to step up its efforts to persuade companies to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.It’s the first time that the $1.2 trillion fund has set a date by which companies it invests in should be at “net zero,” meaning they either emit no carbon or offset their emissions by removing equivalent amounts of carbon from the atmosphere. The 2050 target aligns the fund, which has stakes in over 9,000 companies around the world, with BlackRock and many other large asset managers.To limit the warming of the atmosphere to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with preindustrial levels — the main goal of the Paris climate agreement — scientists calculate that emissions have to reach net zero by 2050.“If you don’t have proper climate ambitions, you don’t have a business,” Nicolai Tangen, chief executive of Norway’s fund, said in an interview before the release of its climate strategy. “With the way things work now, you will not get loans from the bank, you won’t have coverage on the insurance side, you won’t have any clients and you won’t have any people working for you.”Norway’s fund, like other big investors, is calling on companies to come up with credible plans to reduce their emissions. Many large companies have set net-zero plans, but sometimes they lack detail and ambition. In such cases, funds often press management teams and boards to do more. On Tuesday, Norway’s fund said it would sell companies it deemed to be laggards, saying that it would “divest from companies with unmitigated climate risks, especially where engagement has failed or is unlikely to succeed.”Norway’s fund is adding pressure even as investors face challenges to their climate activism.Over the past year, soaring oil and natural gas prices have revived the profits and stock prices of energy companies, underscoring that extracting fossil fuels can still be a winning business financially. In addition, shortages of oil and gas, the result largely of Russia’s actions and the war in Ukraine, have led to calls for energy companies to produce more, not less.And climate initiatives by large asset managers also face growing political opposition from Republicans, who say big investment firms are using their heft to press for progressive policies.“From Wall Street banks to massive asset managers and big tech companies, we have seen the corporate elite use their economic power to impose policies on the country that they could not achieve at the ballot box,” Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida, said this summer.Still, large investment funds may decide to keep their stakes in the companies that emit the most carbon for many years. As shareholders, they can push for more ambitious climate plans and help bring about the biggest reductions in emissions. Large oil companies in theory also have enough money to invest in technologies that can help slash emissions, like the currently very expensive attempts to suck carbon out of the air.“The big integrated energy companies are really the solution here,” Mr. Tangen said.Norway’s fund intends to continue to increase its investments in renewable energy companies and projects. But Mr. Tangen said the fund was struggling to find attractive investments in this field.“The competition is extremely high,” he said. “So the returns you make are very, very low.”</body>

	<title>Three Reasons Puerto Rico Is in the Dark</title>
	<author>Raymond Zhong</author>
	<body>More than a million people in Puerto Rico were without power on Monday, and many were without running water, after Hurricane Fiona dropped 30 inches of rain on the mountainous island, causing widespread damage to homes and infrastructure. President Biden authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to mobilize and coordinate aid. Gov. Pedro Pierluisi told residents to remain at home and in shelters.Fiona has had such a catastrophic impact partly for reasons that long preceded the storm’s landfall. Here are three major ones.In many ways, Puerto Rico is still reeling from its last storm calamity, in September 2017, when Hurricanes Irma and Maria tore through the island only a few weeks apart. Maria killed nearly 3,000 people. It took 11 months to restore power to all customers in the territory — a stretch, combined with that in the U.S. Virgin Islands, that researchers called the largest blackout in the nation’s history, based on the number of people affected and its duration.While FEMA conducted extensive relief work in the storm’s immediate aftermath, federal funds for longer-term recovery on the island became snarled in political squabbling in Congress. The Trump administration also placed restrictions on portions of the island’s aid out of concerns that the money would be mismanaged or squandered. Puerto Rican officials have called these concerns overblown, though they acknowledged that bureaucratic obstacles had impaired recovery projects.The Biden administration began freeing up the aid and removing the restrictions shortly after taking office last year, as part of an effort to address racial disparities in the impact of climate change.Today, even with more government money flowing to Puerto Rico, progress rebuilding after Irma and Maria is still slow.As of last month, the island’s government had spent only about $5.3 billion, or 19 percent, of the $28 billion in funding that FEMA has committed for post-2017 recovery projects, according to Christopher P. Currie, a director in the Government Accountability Office’s homeland security and justice team. A large majority of this spending — 81 percent — has gone to emergency relief, such as debris removal, Mr. Currie said. Considerably less has gone toward permanent works such as improvements to roads and utilities.Mr. Currie disclosed the figures in testimony last week before a House subcommittee regarding FEMA’s work in Puerto Rico since Irma and Maria. He also identified several reasons the recovery has been a slog.Local officials in some parts of Puerto Rico don’t have the experience or understanding of federal regulations to manage FEMA’s grant programs, Mr. Currie said. Inflation has driven up project costs. Municipalities have had trouble hiring engineers and contractors. The parts and materials for construction projects have taken a long time to procure because of delays in global supply chains, Mr. Currie said.Anne Bink, an associate administrator in FEMA’s Office of Response and Recovery, told the same House subcommittee last week that the agency was better prepared to help Puerto Rico weather a big storm than it was in 2017, partly by keeping more emergency supplies on the island.FEMA today has twice the number of generators on Puerto Rico, nine times the water, 10 times the meals and eight times the number of tarps compared with 2017, Ms. Bink said. The agency has also made it easier for homeowners there to receive disaster aid, she said.Scientists will need time to pin down exactly how global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels contributed to Hurricane Fiona. But in general, rising sea levels brought about by climate change are leading to more dangerous storm surges from tropical cyclones: If coastal waters are already elevated, a storm surge can cause damage farther inland. Higher temperatures are also causing more water to evaporate from the oceans, and warmer air holds more moisture. That means storms can come with heavier rain.As the planet continues to get hotter, scientists expect tropical cyclones to become stronger on average globally. There might be slightly fewer, scientific models predict. But each could carry a bigger wallop.Today, scientists are working to understand how climate change is affecting how hurricanes form and where they travel, in addition to their size and strength, said Kevin A. Reed, a climate scientist at Stony Brook University.One recent study found that climate change added 10 percent to peak three-hour rainfall rates during the 2020 North Atlantic hurricane season.“If you get two feet of rain, 10 percent is a couple inches of rain,” Dr. Reed said — enough to cause substantially more damage in vulnerable places. “That’s a lot of rainfall to have in addition to what you would have had before.”</body>

	<title>Physics Body Concedes Mistakes in Study of Missile Defense</title>
	<author>William J. Broad</author>
	<body>The world’s largest body of physicists admitted on Monday that a report it had issued seven months ago contained errors that downplayed the effectiveness of a novel plan for shooting down missiles.The American Physical Society published the 54-page report in February. It assessed the overall feasibility of thwarting missile strikes and concluded that a proposal that the United States use drones to shoot down North Korean missiles faced “very difficult challenges.” The group sent the report to Congress and officials in the Biden administration as part of the society’s long history of providing guidance on cutting-edge weapons to defense policy decision makers.Three months later, in May, the group pulled the document from its website, saying in an online note that the report was under review by its authors and would be “re-posted when available.” The note gave no reason for the withdrawal.But the scientists who proposed the drone idea say the reason was errors in the society’s technical analysis of the concept, which the society acknowledged on its website Monday but has yet to detail or explain.“The whole thing is outrageous,” said Richard L. Garwin, the lead scientist behind the proposal. Dr. Garwin, 94, has advised the U.S. government on issues of national security for more than a half century. He also wields outsize influence in the scientific community because he’s credited with designing — at age 23 in 1951 — the world’s first hydrogen bomb.He and the other proponent of the drone idea say they want Washington officials to have an impartial assessment of the plan as they consider how to improve the nation’s defenses against enemy missiles.“It’s a potential system for the defense of the United States, and these people are trying to stop it,” said Theodore A. Postol, the other scientist and an emeritus professor of science and national security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.A group of 13 physicists and engineers wrote the February report. Its chairman was Frederick K. Lamb of the University of Illinois. The co-chairs were James D. Wells of the University of Michigan and Laura Grego of M.I.T. and the Union of Concerned Scientists. The private group, based in Cambridge, Mass., has often faulted antimissile defense as futile and destabilizing.Academic and private groups have long vetted claims of breakthroughs in destroying enemy warheads fired from the earth’s far side. The task, one of the hardest in modern warfare, is likened to hitting a bullet with a bullet. Members of the American Physical Society have repeatedly caught the Pentagon in errors, exaggerations and what appear to be outright deceptions.Now, the physical society has been caught in its own error. It says the episode is a first in its 123-year history.Dr. Garwin and Dr. Postol’s antimissile plan zeros in on destroying North Korean missiles fired at the United States. After Pyongyang achieved a run of successful flight tests in 2017, American intelligence agencies described its intercontinental ballistic missiles and their nuclear warheads as an emerging threat.According to the plan, American drones would loiter over the Sea of Japan. If North Korea began a nuclear attack, the drones would fire rocket interceptors that would track the fiery exhaust of the rising missiles and annihilate them.If feasible, the idea is seen as superior to the traditional missile defense method — shattering a missile’s incoming warheads as they race toward their targets. Experts agree that rising missiles are slower, easier to track and far more vulnerable to attack.In 2004, the Bush administration began deploying, in Alaska and California, a system of interceptor missiles that has about a half-hour to track long-range warheads fired from North Korea. Even so, top experts say it has major shortcomings.By contrast, the drone interceptors would linger relatively close to enemy launchers. Dr. Garwin and Dr. Postol detailed their plan in 2017 and 2018 studies, prompting the Trump administration to examine the idea as a possible way to thwart the new generation of more threatening North Korean missiles.In 2020, the physical society began its own antimissile study. It looked at the feasibility over the next 15 years of both the old and new approaches, including Dr. Garwin and Dr. Postol’s. It released its report in February.The main error uncovered by Dr. Garwin and Dr. Postol in the society’s report centers on the speed of their proposed interceptor rockets and thus how far they would have to fly. The report’s diagram shows the carrier drones as having to loiter over North Korea’s mainland or a narrow strip of its coastal waters in order to knock out missiles fired at Boston, New York or Washington. In such locations, the drones could be shot down.But the two scientists found that the study group had used the wrong interceptor speed — less than 2.5 miles per second instead of the faster pace of more than 3.1 miles per second. That error might seem small, but the military upshot was not. For an interceptor flight of 195 seconds, the baseline, the correct number was seen as moving the drones more than 100 miles farther out to sea.“It puts you deep inside the Sea of Japan, where you can loiter and take aim at your leisure,” Dr. Postol said. “Theirs puts you into an area where you can’t operate.”Soon after the report’s February release, Dr. Garwin and Dr. Postol began exchanging emails with the report’s authors, which The Times has reviewed. In them, the authors admit to mistakes and suggest corrections.Frances Hellman, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is president of the physical society, said that in late May and early June, it had privately notified key recipients about problems with the report, including staff members at the National Security Council and the Department of Defense, as well as House and Senate armed services subcommittees.But making public a corrected version of the report, she added, “may take a year” from the time of its publication.“We take the integrity of our reports extremely seriously,” Dr. Hellman said in an interview. But removing the errors, she said, is inevitably a slow process because it involves dozens of experts and society officials. “They want it to happen overnight,” she said of Dr. Garwin and Dr. Postol.Dr. Lamb, the report committee’s chairman, said one snag in the revision was that the study group’s members are busy people who “committed time” to the report. “Now we’re in overtime,” he said. Dr. Lamb added that the job required enormous care. “The worst possible thing,” he said, “is to try to correct something and make another mistake.”Dr. Hellman, the society’s president, said that the group was seeking ways to better handle such situations in the future.The long current delay “is not dissimilar to the time it takes to correct a scientific paper,” Dr. Hellman added. “We need to be sure we have the science correct. This argues for more care, not less.”</body>

	<title>Winter Forecast: Gas and Electric Bills Will Soar</title>
	<author>James Barron</author>
	<body>Good morning. It’s Tuesday. We’ll look at why utility bills in New York will probably be significantly higher this winter. We’ll also look at 34 garage doors that became the canvas for an attention-getting art installation.When the temperature is in the 80s, as it will be today and tomorrow, why think about winter? Because utility companies and energy experts expect steeper utility bills for electricity, natural gas and oil.“People are going to be looking at big increases,” said Mark Wolfe, the executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, which projects that heating costs will rise 12 percent nationally, outpacing inflation.But he said the increases in New York are likely to be steeper.Con Edison has already predicted that a typical customer’s electric bill in its territory in New York City will climb 22 percent, to $116 a month, from $95 a month last winter. The company said it expects the typical natural gas user’s bill for heating and cooking to jump 32 percent, to $460 a month, from $348 a month last winter.National Grid, which supplies natural gas in Brooklyn, Staten Island and parts of Queens, projected a 28 percent increase from last year. It said the increase for its customers on Long Island would be $299, up 29 percent from last year.Energy prices became a dreaded question mark in household budgets after Russia invaded Ukraine — how high would gasoline prices go as the strain on global energy supplies continued?Wolfe said last week that energy prices appeared to be stabilizing, “but they’re stabilizing at a very high level.” He estimated that homes with oil heat in New York would spend $239 more over the coming five-month heating season than they spent a year ago, or an average of $2,115 this winter, up from $1,876 last winter.But based on current inventories, a cold winter could compound the pressure on prices, said Rocco Lacertosa, the chief executive of the New York State Energy Coalition, representing heating oil dealers.And it could be a very cold winter. New York was under the words “significant shivers — slushy, icy, snowy” on the map with the forecast from the Farmers’ Almanac. The forecast said December “looks stormy and cold nationwide,” with the East under “an active storm pattern.” January could bring “one of the coldest outbreaks of Arctic air we have seen in several years.”“We’re in a potential perfect storm,” Lacertosa said. “I hate to say that, but I’m concerned about consumers, I’m concerned about dealers being able to do what they need to do and pay their own bills.” As for the direction of energy prices, “I’m not going to be that optimistic right now,” he said.Utility bills are already piling up. Wolfe estimated that one in six families is behind nationwide. The American Rescue Plan, a big pandemic relief package that was approved last year, set aside $4.5 billion in addition to almost $4 billion from the Home Energy Assistance Program. New York State has its own arrears forgiveness program, with more than $800 million available to wipe out past due utility bills for low-income households.But as my colleague Isabella Simonetti noted, when a household is cold in the winter, the temptation is to turn to potentially deadly solutions — like space heaters. One that had been left running for days caught fire in an apartment in a high-rise in the Bronx in January. Smoke from the burning heater poured into the hallway because the door to the apartment with the heater had not closed by itself when the residents fled, as it was supposed to. The smoke spread through the building, and 17 people died.Con Edison acknowledged the pain that higher bills can cause by releasing its winter forecast in early September, rather than in late October or early November, as in past years. “We recognize it’s a hardship,” said Jamie McShane, a Con Edison spokesman.Con Edison attributed the increases to the cost of natural gas. Of the $112 increase for gas customers, it said that $90 was for the gas, and that it was just passing along the price it pays because it does not mark up the wholesale price.Higher gas prices also affect the cost of electricity because generating plants run mainly on natural gas, so whenever the price of natural gas goes up, it is followed by a corresponding increase in the cost of electricity.WeatherIt will be a mostly sunny day with above-normal temperatures as a high-pressure system builds. Tonight, expect clear skies and lows in the 60s.ALTERNATE-SIDE PARKINGIn effect until Sept. 26 (Rosh Hashana).U.N.

They were concentrating on their brushwork.They were painting part of a four-block-long mural in the West Village — if you think of a long line of roll-up garage doors at a UPS delivery facility as a mural. The 34 loading-dock doors have gone from bland to bright in the last few days. One got a makeover in Miami Green and Bahama Sea Blue. Another became half Berry Wine Oriole and half Grape Green.Hudson Square Properties, which is putting up an office building across Greenwich Avenue from the UPS center, enlisted the nonprofit Publicolor to brighten the neighborhood. Publicolor, which runs programs for students at risk of dropping out, sees painting as a way to prepare them for later life. It says that all of the students in its tutoring programs and after-school workshops go on to college or accredited programs after high school.Its students have spruced up more than 300 schools and 250 community facilities since Publicolor began in the 1990s, including a building in Downtown Brooklyn that the Howell sisters worked on during the summer. Domenicia said the walls there were “bumpy.”Hudson Square Properties approached UPS about painting the gates. “We’re honored to be the canvas,” said Laura James, a global community director with the UPS Foundation. She described the look before the mural makeover as “gray — not apocalyptic but nothing fun to look at.” Domenicia described it as “old and rusty and plain.”Not anymore. Ruth Lande Shuman, the founder of Publicolor, worked out the design and arranged the colors, and Hudson Square Properties covered the costs and assembled 280 volunteers from 57 companies, many of which are tenants in buildings in its commercial real estate portfolio in the area. They worked with 80 students from Publicolor.“This was a huge departure for us,” James said. “We tend to fade into the background. We’re going to have to get used to being the pretty one on the block.”METROPOLITAN diaryDear Diary:In 1975, my older sister, a single mother in her late 20s, moved from Vermont to an apartment in the West 80s in Manhattan.

	<title>Near Miss at a Nuclear Site</title>
	<author>Yana Dlugy</author>
	<body>Welcome to the Russia-Ukraine War Briefing, your guide to the latest news and analysis about the conflictThe war in Ukraine is casting a long shadow over the gathering of world leaders at the U.N. this week. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, attended the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in London. No Russian representative was present.The Russian pop icon Alla Pugacheva has denounced the war, the most significant celebrity to do so.Follow our live updates. Track the invasion with our maps.A Russian missile exploded less than 900 feet from the reactors of an atomic plant in the southern Mykolaiv region today, Ukrainian officials said.The attack at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk  rekindled worries about the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities.There was no damage to essential safety equipment at the plant, which remained fully operational, and no casualties were reported. But the explosion caused extensive damage around a hydroelectric power station in the industrial zone that surrounds the nuclear complex.The plant is Ukraine’s second-largest functioning nuclear power station and is some 300 miles west of the larger Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which has been occupied by Russian troops since March.After weeks of shelling, the situation around Zaporizhzhia appears to have stabilized in recent days. The plant resumed receiving electricity from the country’s power grid on Saturday, but the plant’s reactors have been shut down as a safety precaution.Before the war, Ukraine had 15 working reactors at four nuclear power plants that produced more than half of its electricity, the second highest share among European nations after France.At the frontIn the northeast, Ukrainian troops pressed on after last week’s rout, and yesterday the military said that its forces had crossed the Oskil River, which flows south toward the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russian troops had established their new defensive line along the Oskil after being driven out of Kharkiv.The claim could not be independently verified, but over the weekend, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research organization, said that Ukrainian forces “appeared to be expanding positions east of the Oskil.”In its offensives in the east and south, Ukraine faces a tougher challenge, as Russian troops are much more entrenched there than they were in the northeast.In the east, Russian forces continued to attack Bakhmut, a city with a prewar population of 70,000, that is critical to the Kremlin’s objective of taking the entire Donbas region.Ukrainian troops said there seemed to be an unending supply of soldiers around Bakhmut, many of them not among the regular Russian ranks. There was no indication of any mass Russian withdrawal, and Russian forces have continued to assault Ukrainian positions and pound Ukrainian towns and villages.Ukrainian officers said the Russians are making use of a new and frighteningly effective weapon: Iranian-made Shahed-136 attack drones.The weapon explodes on impact, carrying a warhead of about 80 pounds. The appearance of the so-called kamikaze drone in Ukraine marks the first time it has been deployed outside the Middle East.After U.S.-provided weapons and intelligence proved instrumental in Ukraine’s gains in the northeast, President Volodymyr Zelensky is pressing President Biden for a new and more powerful weapon: the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, which has a range of 190 miles and could reach far into Russian territory.Zelensky has argued that the missile system is critical to launching a wider counteroffensive, perhaps early next year. But aides said that Biden was resisting, in part because he does not want a broader war with Russia — he just wants it out of Ukraine.U.S. Air Force analysts are now sharing information in real time about Russian air-launched missiles and other airborne threats with their Ukrainian counterparts, the top American air commander in Europe said.After the warWhile no one is predicting a quick end to the war, governments and the private sector have already begun to think about reconstruction.Estimates of what it would cost to rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure and revive its shattered economy vary widely. The Ukrainian government has put the bill at $750 billion, while others have estimated around $100 billion would be needed for infrastructure. Zelensky discussed how to attract investment during a video call last week with the head of BlackRock, the world’s largest manager of assets that oversees $8.5 trillion invested all over the world.JOIN US ON TELEGRAMFollow our coverage of the war on the @nytimes channel.Ukraine is facing a host of crises, but one of the most urgent is preparing damaged homes for winter.  So many windows have been shattered by explosions — “millions of them,” one humanitarian official estimated — that there is a nationwide run on glass, my colleague Jeffrey Gettleman writes.Across the country, no building appears to have been spared — not the high rises, not the schools, not the squat little cottages. Just today, a strike near a nuclear power plant in the south blew out more than 100 of its windows.The advantages that glass provides can be seen all over. Plywood may cover a hole in the wall, but it darkens the inside space, which can be depressing. The scraps of tablecloths or plastic film that a lot of people are using might let in sunlight but also don’t seal well, leaving people curled up at night under three blankets, dreading winter.Even before the war, Ukraine had glass issues because one of its biggest factories was in eastern Donbas and shut down after being bombed by the pro-Russian rebellion.Ukraine became heavily reliant on Russia and Belarus for supplies. But the war has cut those links, so now almost all of Ukraine’s glass is imported, much of it from pricier European markets.To provide comprehensive coverage of the war, we often link to outside sources. Some of these require a subscription.In UkraineMcDonald’s said that it would reopen three restaurants in Kyiv this week.The war has reduced Ukraine’s grain storage by nearly 15 percent, a report said.In RussiaRussia and China agreed to carry out more joint military exercises and enhance defense cooperation.Around the worldRussia has spread conspiracy theories that blame the West for global food shortages, according to disinformation experts.High energy prices have forced many factories in Europe to slash production and furlough employees.We also recommendUkraine’s Donbas has long contained many conflicting opinions on its identity and is an integral part of President Vladimir Putin’s war. The Times explains why capping the price of Russian oil, a plan backed by the Group of 7 countries, is complicated.The war has given Kazakhstan an opening to quietly dismantle its alliance with Russia, Temur Umarov writes in Foreign Policy.Thanks for reading.

	<title>The Godwit’s Long, Long Nonstop Journey</title>
	<author>Jim Robbins</author>
	<body>Tens of thousands of bar-tailed godwits are taking advantage of favorable winds this month and next for their annual migration from the mud flats and muskeg of southern Alaska, south across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, to the beaches of New Zealand and eastern Australia.They are making their journey of more than 7,000 miles by flapping night and day, without stopping to eat, drink or rest.“The more I learn, the more amazing I find them,” said Theunis Piersma, a professor of global flyway ecology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and an expert in the endurance physiology of migratory birds. “They are a total evolutionary success.”The godwit’s epic flight — the longest nonstop migration of a land bird in the world — lasts from eight to 10 days and nights through pounding rain, high winds and other perils. It is so extreme, and so far beyond what researchers knew about long-distance bird migration, that it has required new investigations.In a recent paper, a group of researchers said the arduous journeys challenge “underlying assumptions of bird physiology, orientation, and behavior,” and listed 11 questions posed by such migrations. Dr. Piersma called the pursuit of answers to these questions “the new ornithology.”The extraordinary nature of what bar-tailed and other migrating birds accomplish has been revealed in the last 15 years or so with improvements to tracking technology, which has given researchers the ability to follow individual birds in real time and in a detailed way along the full length of their journey.“You know where a bird is almost to the meter, you know how high it is, you know what it’s doing, you know its wing-beat frequency,” Dr. Piersma said. “It’s opened a whole new world.”(Sea-faring Polynesian cultures, the scientists wrote in the paper, knew about the migrations long ago and used the birds to assist in navigation.)The known distance record for a godwit migration is 13,000 kilometers, or nearly 8,080 miles. It was set last year by an adult male bar-tailed godwit with a tag code of 4BBRW that encountered inclement weather on his way to New Zealand and veered off course to a more distant landing in Australia. He had flapped his wings for 237 hours without stopping when he touched down. (In the last week, he has left Alaska again and is en route to his southern destination.)Other birds do stay aloft for long periods using a technique called “dynamic soaring,” while godwits power themselves by continuous flapping, which takes far more energy.The globe-trotting birds are in search of an endless summer, and some 90,000 or so depart Alaska from the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and environs, where they breed and raise their young. Both Alaska and New Zealand are rich in foods that godwits like, especially the insects in Alaska for newly hatched chicks. And New Zealand has no predatory falcons, while Alaska offers secure habitat.Once they reach New Zealand and the austral summer, the sleek birds — with mottled brown-and-white aerodynamic wings; cinnamon-colored breasts; long, slender beaks; and stilt-like legs — feed on glistening mud flats until March, when they begin their journey back north.The birds are cherished by many New Zealanders. The cathedral at Christchurch began ringing its bells to welcome the birds, but an earthquake in 2011 toppled the bell tower. Another cathedral in the city of Nelson has taken over the task and will ring its bells for the birds later this month.“I tell people try exercising for nine straight days — not stopping, not eating, not drinking — to convey what’s going on here,” said Robert E. Gill Jr., a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Anchorage who has studied the birds in Alaska since 1976. “It stretches the imagination.”Distances vary, but all told, in a year, the godwits cover some 30,000 kilometers, or nearly 18,720 miles, because they take a less direct route to return north in March. They fly nonstop from New Zealand to China’s Yellow Sea and its rich tidal flats, where they refuel, and then return to Alaska. And they are proficient at the incredibly risky endeavor; the survival rate is more than 90 percent.“It’s not really like a marathon,” said Christopher Guglielmo, an animal physiologist at Western University in London, Ontario, who studies avian endurance physiology. “It’s more like a trip to the moon.”The journey of these ultra-endurance athletes is made possible by a suite of adaptations.Godwits are avian shape-shifters, endowed with an unusual plasticity. Their internal organs undergo a “strategic restructuring” before departure. The gizzards, kidneys, livers and guts shrink to lighten the load for the trans-Pacific journey. Pectoral muscles grow before takeoff to support the constant flapping the trip requires.They are built for speed, with aerodynamic wings and a missile-shaped body. The only baggage the birds carry is fat, by gobbling up insects, worms and mollusks to double their weight from one to two pounds before embarking on their trip. Because godwits directly use fat to fuel their flight, Dr. Guglielmo in one paper called them “obese super athletes.”Bird lungs are the most efficient lungs of any vertebrate and help the godwits’ performance in the thin atmosphere of higher altitudes. Bar-tailed godwits in Russia have recently been documented flying at altitudes of three to four miles above ground.No other birds make the same length of powered migration under such punishing conditions, but recent research shows that common swifts stay airborne for virtually all of the 10 months when they’re not breeding or nesting, although they eat and drink during that time.Climate change and other factors are bearing down on migratory shorebirds around the world. In Alaska, for example, rising sea levels are lapping at the nesting sites of godwits and important grassy habitat is being ‘shrub-ified’ — taken over by shrubs — because of warmer temperatures. Experts are also worried about avian influenza, which has spread globally among wild birds this year and is often lethal.Wayfinding among the godwits is among the biggest questions recent studies have prompted. “What mechanisms explain birds acting as if they possess a Global Positioning System?” researchers asked. Crossing a nearly featureless Pacific Ocean without navigational cues required an internal “map to define position and a compass to tell direction,” they said. The birds find their way back to the same specific sites at the end of their flight, something they do for each of the 15 or 20 years of their lives.“They have figured out the aerosphere they live in,” Dr. Gill said. “They can predict when to leave and when not to leave, how high to fly, and they know exactly where they are and they know their destination.”The godwits probably rely on several cues for navigation, especially the sun and stars. Some experts believe that they may be able to sense magnetic lines on the planet through a process called quantum entanglement.The birds also possess an uncanny knack for weather forecasting.“They know what conditions to leave on that will not only provide wind at the start that is favorable, but throughout their entire flight,” Dr. Gill said. “They can piece the puzzle together in terms of what the conditions are in Alaska and between there and Hawaii, between Hawaii and Fiji, and between Fiji and New Zealand. How migration abilities are passed on to the next generation — whether genetically or learned or a combination — is still unknown.“You study adults, and you think these birds just have it down, they are super robots, they are amazing,” said Jesse Conklin, an independent researcher at the University of Groningen who studies the species. “But when you study young birds, they make mistakes and do all kinds of weird stuff. So they weren’t just born with this routine.”Incredibly, it is possible that three-month-old godwit juveniles fly their nonstop maiden voyage without adult supervision. That has yet to be confirmed.The energetics of their nonstop migration are also a conundrum. Current models say the birds should conk out after three or four days, yet they fly for more than a week. “We can’t explain the physiology that allows them to do this,” Dr. Guglielmo said. “We know what the energy costs should be from wind tunnel experiments, but when we try to use our models, the energy costs we know they used are much lower.” The birds use half or less of the energy expected.One answer may be that the birds can lower their metabolic rate on these journeys, burning far less energy than they would for other kinds of flying. “Are they going into a suspended animation state when they are doing these monster flights?” Dr. Guglielmo asked. “I don’t think they are in a normal physiological state when they are doing this,” he said, adding they might enter into a state like something akin to “marathon runners getting into the zone.”Whether or how the birds sleep is another mystery. It’s been shown that some bird species are capable of unihemispheric sleep, that is, putting one half of their brain to bed while using the other half to fly. Others believe the birds don’t sleep at all but catch up on their rest when they reach New Zealand.Experts believe the birds communicate frequently, especially about the timing and safety of their trip. Some suggest that the birds gather to create a kind of group mind that helps them make decisions on important matters and take votes on migration, among other things.“It’ll be near hurricane weather and a bird will be stamping around the estuary, calling, trying to get someone to go with her,” Dr. Conklin said. “I watched a bird do this for five days straight. Her clock said go, and everybody else said no. She got outvoted.”She stayed, he said, “but as soon as the weather turned, she was in the first flock out.”</body>
